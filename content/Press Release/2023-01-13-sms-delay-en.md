Summary: From Wednesday 2023/01/11 to Friday 2023/01/13 (JST) there was a delay of up to 12 hours and 47 minutes in SMS delivery for both EZSMS and Xoxzo.

Thank you for using our services [EZSMS](https://www.ezsms.biz/ja/) and [Xoxzo](https://www.xoxzo.com/ja/) .

[As we've previously mentioned on Twitter](https://twitter.com/xoxzocom), 
from Wednesday 2023/01/11 to Friday 2023/01/13 (JST) there was a delay of up to 12 hours and 47 minutes 
in SMS delivery for both EZSMS and Xoxzo.

We confirmed the delay around 9:40 AM (JST) on 2023/01/11, and we took various measures possible such as route adjustment, 
but it took us until 2:00 AM on 2023/01/13 to finish this.
This delay seems being caused by the extremely high number of requests on the day. 
We figured out the root cause on this issue and it would help to deal with such high number of
requests to prevent the reoccurrance delays.<pr>

We apologize for any inconvenience we may have caused to our customers.


We will contact the affected users individually with details.
