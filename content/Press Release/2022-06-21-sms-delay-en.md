Summary: On June 16th, 2022 SMS deliveries were delayed due to frequent timeouts from carriers and an unusually high number of requests.

Thank you for using our services [EZSMS](https://www.ezsms.biz/ja/) and [Xoxzo](https://www.xoxzo.com/ja/) .

[As we've previously mentioned on Twitter](https://twitter.com/xoxzocom/status/1537357487632171008 )On Thursday June 16th, 2022
there was a delay of up to 5 hours and 28 minutes in SMS delivery for both EZSMS and Xoxzo.

This delay was due to a timeout from carriers, which had been more frequent since the afternoon of the previous day, 
as well as a higher than expected number of requests on the day.
We confirmed the delay around 10:10 am, and we took measures such as route adjustment, but it took us until 5:55 pm to finish this.

We apologize for any inconvenience we may have caused to our customers.

In the future, we plan to review our monitoring system and consider automation so that we can respond to the status of each carrier more accurately and promptly.

We will contact the affected users individually with details.
