Summary: Xoxzo released a new rebate function for DIN 24 hours only subscription.

Thank you for your continuous support for [Xoxzo Cloud Telephony Platform](https://www.xoxzo.com/en/).

On February 16, 2017, Xoxzo released a new rebate function for [DIN
(Dial-in-Numbers)](https://www.xoxzo.com/en/about/voice-api/#din) for subscribed
numbers released within 24 hours of subscription.

The Dial In Number standard subscription plan has up until now only supported a
fixed 30-day subscription rate, which is automatically renewed every 30 days.
This new additional functionality will refund a certain amount of credits to
your account *if the acquired number is released within 24 hours of
subscription.*

We are responding to customer requests to allow for a more flexible pricing for
DINs during their development phase to integrate DINs to their system, or for
specific use cases like authentication where the DINs are only used for a short
period of time.

The details of the rebates and it's amount can be found [here](https://www.xoxzo.com/en/about/pricing/voice/#din)

Detailed instructions on how to use DIN can be found in the [API documentation](http://docs.xoxzo.com/en/din.html#)

Thank you once again for using [Xoxzo Cloud Telephony Platform](https://www.xoxzo.com/en/).
