Summary: We apologize for any inconvenience caused by this issue

Thank you for using [Xoxzo, Cloud Telephony Platform](https://www.xoxzo.com/en/).

As we notified [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/xoxzocom/status/1105640753466732544),
our Voice functionality was unavailable from 6AM to 10.31AM (JST) on March 13, 2019.

During this time, our Voice functionalities on both incoming calls and outgoing calls, 
[Xoxzo Voice APIs](https://www.xoxzo.com/en/about/voice-api/)
and [Dial in Numbers(DIN)](https://www.xoxzo.com/en/about/voice-api/#din) were not working.

This is caused by our regular maintenance process and we have applied the possible improvement to future issue prevention. 

We are deeply sorry for any inconvenience or loss caused by this issue, for any questions, please contact us at anytime.

Thank you for your continuous support from the team Xoxzo.
