Summary: Text-to-Speech (TTS) is now available on our API Dial in Number(DIN). Not only making outbound calls, you can now provide your favorite information spoken out on received calls!!


Thank you for using [Xoxzo, Cloud Telephony Platform](https://www.xoxzo.com/en/).

We are excited to announce that Text-to-Speech (TTS) add-on is now with our Dial in Number(DIN) API.

Dial In Numbers (DIN) are numbers which you can subscribe and receive calls with. When a call is received at one of these numbers, we'll make a GET request to a URL you specify that will contain commands on how to process the call (i.e transfer it to another number, play a music file or read something from text via Text-to-Speech).

For more details on using TTS with our DIN API, please refer to the [documentation](http://docs.xoxzo.com/en/din.html#available-actions) and the [website](https://www.xoxzo.com/en/about/dial-in-api/).

Please find the prices on our [price page](https://www.xoxzo.com/en/about/dial-in-pricing/).

Thank you for your continuous support from the team Xoxzo.
