Summary: Text-to-Speech (TTS) is also now available through our Dial in Numbers (DIN). You can now provide your favorite information spoken out on received calls.


Thank you for using [Xoxzo, Cloud Telephony Platform](https://www.xoxzo.com/en/).

We are excited to announce that Text-to-Speech (TTS) add-on is now also usable
with our Dial in Numbers (DIN).

Dial In Numbers (DIN) are numbers which you can subscribe and receive calls with. When a call is received at one of these numbers, we'll make a GET request to a URL you specify that will contain commands on how to process the call (i.e transfer it to another number, play a music file or read something from text via Text-to-Speech).

For more details on using TTS with our DIN API, please refer to the [documentation](http://docs.xoxzo.com/en/din.html#available-actions) and the [website](https://www.xoxzo.com/en/about/dial-in-api/).

Please find the prices on our [price page](https://www.xoxzo.com/en/about/dial-in-pricing/).

Thank you for your continuous support from the team Xoxzo.
