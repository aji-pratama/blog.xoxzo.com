Summary: Xoxzo is joining the Kyubiz group after Kyubiz Invest acquires 100% of Xoxzo shares

Xoxzo, Inc. has been on a journey of evolution since 2007, starting as the service "Marimore" and gradually transforming over time. For 17 years, we have continued to move forward, adapting to the changing needs of the times.

Today, Xoxzo offers SMS services that leverage the advantages of international SMS networks, making them available for immediate use, even by non-corporate customers.

We operate two key services tailored to different needs:

EZSMS: A user-friendly SMS platform that allows for easy SMS sending via a web browser.
Xoxzo: A telephony API primarily focused on SMS delivery for developers.
These services are designed to meet the diverse needs of various industries.

We are pleased to announce that on December 25, 2024, Accrete Inc., the parent company of Xoxzo, Inc., transferred 100% of its shares to KYUBIZ INVEST, Inc.

As a result, Xoxzo, Inc. became a subsidiary of KYUBIZ INVEST, Inc..

Under the Xoxzo brand, we will continue to provide enhanced services to our valued customers. Through integration with the KYUBIZ Group, a company dedicated to advancing the SMS delivery industry, we expect to see significant improvements in efficiency and innovation. This will be achieved by sharing and complementing the technologies and resources cultivated by both companies, ultimately enhancing the value we deliver to our customers.

Furthermore, the new perspectives and resources gained through this integration will not only support the growth of our employees but also strengthen our ability to provide value to our customers.

Thank you and best wishes,
