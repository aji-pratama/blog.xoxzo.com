Summary: On July 5th, 2022 SMS deliveries were delayed. We are currently investigating the causes.

Thank you for using our services [EZSMS](https://www.ezsms.biz/ja/) and [Xoxzo](https://www.xoxzo.com/ja/) .

[As we've previously mentioned on Twitter](https://twitter.com/xoxzocom/status/1544159152574201857) On Tuesday July 5th, 2022
there was a delay of up to 5 hours and 28 minutes in SMS delivery for both EZSMS and Xoxzo.

We confirmed the delay around 9:50 am, and we took measures such as route adjustment, but it took us until 3:15 pm to finish this.
This delay seems being caused by the timeouts from carriers, which had been more frequent than usual, 
as well as an extremely high number of requests on the day, but the details are still under investigation.
We prioritize to figure out the root cause on this issue and examine the measurements how to prevent the recurrance.<pr>

We apologize for any inconvenience we may have caused to our customers.

In the future, we plan to review our monitoring system and consider automation so that we can respond to the status of each carrier more accurately and promptly.

We will contact the affected users individually with details.
