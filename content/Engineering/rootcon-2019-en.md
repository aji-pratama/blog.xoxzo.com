rootcon is a security conference held annually in the philippines and it was at its 13th iteration this year.
josef, one of our engineers, is from the philppines and aside from python and raspberry pies, security is one of his areas of interest.
rootcon 13 has long been in josef's calendar and now that the event has concluded, he has some thoughta to share.

security is one of those areas where continuous learning and improvement is essential.
it's a domain where the truth in the addage "knowledge is power" is realized in many ways.
And when we stop, the rest of the world leaves us behind.

attackers and defenders are always one-upping one another and it's really hard to catch up with everything happening.
in the computing landscape where hardware, software and people interact, there are a lot of ways for malicious actors to find and exploit vulnerabilities.


hardware

we hear security people say that hardware manufacturers aren't giving enough to secure the devices they create.
let's forget for a moment all the unsecured devices that are connected to the internet, the misconfigured devices or devices with default credentials deployed in a lot of places.
even if security measures have been taken, physical access to a device spells "game over" for many of them.
if physical access can't be secured, there's also wireless access, which further opens up a lot of possibilities others to exploit.
nowadays we see more and more "smart" devices in our homes and offices, increasing the surface area that attackers can take advantage of.

in this year's rootcon, there was a car hacking village demonstrating a device that connects and manupulates a car's dashboard using a game controller.
so not only do we think of security in our homes and offices, our methods of transportation are also getting hacked.
aside from the car hacking village, there was a hardware hacking village where people could solder their own badge, and i seem to have spent a little too much time hanging out in the lockpicking village...

speaking of hardware, look at my badge!


software

software is changing at a very fast pace. as someone in this line of work, i experience this everyday.
we hear security people say that software developers don't think about securing their (our) applications enough.
aside from the software we write, there's software we rely on, software written by others.
this occurs on many levels: it can be some library, package, another application, the OS or even external services we're using. it's every other code that surrounds it.
thanks to this, we don't have to reinvent the wheel.
it makes creating other software faster and easier, but it also opens up our software to vulnerabilities not only because of what we wrote but because of what others wrote!

with all the code we rely on, it may be just a matter of time when a vulnerability suddenly appears in any of them.
the flip side to this is we don't have to use the latest tech all the time.
latest doesn't necessarily mean stable and secure.
we have a choice between possibly old and unpatched or latest and unstable, both can be equally vulnerable.

in the end we have to strive for balance.
we need to keep on updating and moving forward with technology, but keep things stable.
but we can't slack off, it relies on how fast we can keep ourselves updated so that we can also make proper updates to our software, fix bugs and patch holes.


people

in the end, people still play a very important part of the whole system.
not only do we need to constantly update our software and hardware but also our people-ware.
we, "IT people", need to constantly update our knowledge of the potential threats that may affect our systems.
new threats are constantly discovered while the "normal users" usually remain oblivious.
This lack of awareness is one of those things that are taken advantage of by attackers.

to guard against social engineering, we need to educate the everyday user with the proper knowledge to defend themselves.
this will help not only in securing the company but their personal lives as well.
as new threats are discovered and the usual social engineering tactics become less effective, attackers can also get creative with their methods.
contstant training should be made available to the everyday user and every person in the technology industry should spend some time learning about security.

And that is why I always try to attend this conference.

we should always be learning.
