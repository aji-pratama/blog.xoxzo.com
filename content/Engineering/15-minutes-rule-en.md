Summary: Here is one of the golden rule we follow at Xoxzo to keep up a good productivity within a remotely working team


Xoxzo has no physical office and every one of us has own residence here and there in Asian and Russian region working together remotely.

Our daily communication are done through ‘Slack’ text chat and some voice and video conference as necessary. This cause less density between the members than working in an office. To keep up our productivities under this circumstance, Xoxzo has some of the rules that our engineering team are sharing. Here is one:

## 15 MIN RULE: Ask everyone AFTER you try to solve for 15 min

More excellent engineer tends to be more disgraceful to ask. He/she may spend too long time to solve a problem on his/her own. Well it is an admiring attitude, but what if this problem had already been solved once before by the other member, or what if there is alternative method you can take and this problem may not be a problem at all?

It is the basic of productivity improvement NOT to waste hours for nothing as there are a lot to do within developer’s projects.  

But still, it is not so easy to ask, as asking questions would take up time of someone else, no matter if it is done through ‘slack’, it surely does bother someone who are on the own work. It is even more difficult to ask within the remote work members as we do not know what situation they are in, on the other side of inorganic communication tool… this pushes engineers more to solve on their own.

Our team has 15 min rule, and this is regularly reminded to everyone to help making ourselves easy to ask questions.
