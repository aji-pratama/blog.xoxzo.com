Summary: Letâ€™s learn more about search path for Python import

It is a frequently happening problem for Python programmer that modules and packages that they want to `import` are not found.

```
>>> import foo
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'foo'
```
The first step to solve this problem is to recognize that it is placed in a variable named `sys.path` where to look for the modules and packages that Python Interpreter would import.
The format of this variable is a list.

For example, on `Ubuntu 14.04` that I have here it will be like this:
```
$ /usr/bin/python3
>>> import sys
>>> print(sys.path)
['', '/usr/lib/python3.4', '/usr/lib/python3.4/plat-x86_64-linux-gnu', 
    '/usr/lib/python3.4/lib-dynload', '/usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages',
     '/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages', '/usr/lib/python3.4/dist-packages']
>>> print(len(sys.path))
7
```
The path `sys.path` is highly depended on the package called `site` which is loaded as default.
You can use an option `-S` when you launch Python interpreter not to load `site` package.
Here we can see the contents of `sys.path` when we manually `import` `site`.

```
$ /usr/bin/python3 -S
>>> import sys
>>> print(sys.path)
['', '/usr/lib/python3.4/', '/usr/lib/python3.4/plat-x86_64-linux-gnu', 
    '/usr/lib/python3.4/lib-dynload']
>>> print(len(sys.path))
4
>>> import site
>>> print(len(sys.path))
7
```

There will be `sys.path[0]`, Python script directory given at launching Python Interpreter at the beginning of this list. Thus the directory of the script is launched will be searched by `import`
`sys.path[0]` will be empty when Python Interpreter was launched interactively, this means current directory.

Be aware of the value of environmental variable `PYTHONPATH` that is inserted in `sys.path` at the launch and it must be right after `sys.path[0]`

```
$ export PYTHONPATH="/foo/bar/baz"
$ /usr/bin/python3
>>> import sys
>>> print(sys.path)
['', '/foo/bar/baz', '/usr/lib/python3.4', '/usr/lib/python3.4/plat-x86_64-linux-gnu', 
    '/usr/lib/python3.4/lib-dynload', '/usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages', 
    '/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages', '/usr/lib/python3.4/dist-packages']
```

`sys.path` can be modified as you like, for example, you can add your favorite directory in search path of `import` from Python script as following.

```
>>> sys.path[0:0]=['/my/python/dir']
>>> print(sys.path)
['/my/python/dir', '', '/foo/bar/baz', '/usr/lib/python3.4', ...
```
