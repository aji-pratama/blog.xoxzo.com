Thank you for using Xoxzo - Cloud Telephony Platform.

We are glad to announce a new feature release, “callbackurl” parameter to be used in both SMS API and Voice API.

With this parameter, you will be able to receive the result of your action at your favorite URL. Status of SMS delivery will be called when the carrier network notifies Xoxzo of the SMS delivery status (DLR) and status of Voice will be called when the call ended.
Please refer these sample code for how to use this parameter.
