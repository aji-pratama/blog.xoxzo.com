Summary: PyCon JP 2019: It just gets bigger and bigger!

This year's [PyCon JP](https://pycon.jp/2019/) was held from Monday 16th to 17th September
at the Ota-Ku PiO, the same venue we had in 2018

As a run up to the conference, they also had sprints on Saturday 14th and workshops
on the 15th of September.

We at Xoxzo consider PyCon JP as one of the important events in our calendar. In
2018, we were one of the the sponsors and had a booth, but this year I wanted to
have more personal interactions with old and new friends that I will meet, so
we didn't get a booth and only myself and [Akira](https://twitter.com/anonaka)
went to the conference.

## Talks

[PyRun - Shipping the Python 3.7 runtime in just 4.8MB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fU-yR5PPI58)

This talk by Marc-Andre Lemburg was very useful and informative.
We often want to bundle python runtime with our application
so that the application code is not affected by the target environment.
This tool is very useful to avoid the problems such as caused by the
python interpreter version difference.
Officially python 3.5 or later is not supported yet, but internally
it is done already and will be released shortly after this conference
according to Marc.

[Implementing profiler for web application](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojnVMGon5d4)  

Python ウェブアプリケーションのためのプロファイラの実装(Yusuke Miyazaki)

This talk was in Japanese by Yusuke Miyazaki about implementing profiler for web application.
It was very interesting that I can add many functionarities very easily using WISG middleware.
I felt like I wanted to write some handy tools using this interface.

## Lightning Talk

As per tradition, they had 5-minute so-called "Lightning Talks" (or LT) at the end of
the conference: A chance for you to address everyone at the conference with a
short topic of your choosing. Usually this will be about a certain library, or a
certain topic which you are passionate about and want more people to be aware
of.

This year for at the end of the conference days, the organizers have scheduled
pre-choosen lightning talks, and made time for "LT of the day", which are LT
chosen from a ballot from a bunch of applicants who put their names in a box.

On the first conference day, I was chosen as the first LT speaker from the "LT
of the day" ballot. 


# Wrapping it up

This was the 10th time we had PyCon JP in Japan. It has been a long way since
we started mini PyCon in January 2011, with 100 people coming. This is it was
over a thousand attendees.
