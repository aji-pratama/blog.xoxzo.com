Summary: PyCon JP 2019: It just gets bigger and bigger!

This year's [PyCon JP](https://pycon.jp/2019/) was held from Monday 16th to 17th September
at the Ota-Ku PiO, the same venue we had in 2018

As a run up to the conference, they also had sprints on Saturday 14th and workshops
on the 15th of September.

We at Xoxzo consider PyCon JP as one of the important events in our calendar. In
2018, we were one of the the sponsors and had a booth, but this year I wanted to
have more personal interactions with old and new friends that I will meet, so
we didn't get a booth and only myself and [Akira](https://twitter.com/anonaka)
went to the conference.

# PyCon JP 2019 Conference Day


## Talks


## Lightning Talk

As per tradition, they had 5-minute so-called "Lightning Talks" (or LT) at the end of
the conference: A chance for you to address everyone at the conference with a
short topic of your choosing. Usually this will be about a certain library, or a
certain topic which you are passionate about and want more people to be aware
of.

This year for at the end of the conference days, the organizers have scheduled
pre-choosen lightning talks, and made time for "LT of the day", which are LT
chosen from a ballot from a bunch of applicants who put their names in a box.

On the first conference day, I was chosen as the first LT speaker from the "LT
of the day" ballot. 


# Wrapping it up

This was the 10th time we had PyCon JP in Japan. It has been a long way since
we started mini PyCon in January 2011, with 100 people coming. This is it was
over a thousand attendees.
