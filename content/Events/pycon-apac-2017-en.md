This is my memory of attending PyCon APAC 2017, held on August 26 & 27, 2017 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

My outward flight was a mid-night flight, D7 523 (Air Asia) departed Haneda at 23.45 and arrived in Kuala Lumpur at 5.50 AM. Inside the plane was unexpectedly freezingand I was chilled into the marrow because of my mid-summer outfit. It was oh so long flight to me…

Xoxzo has a quite unique working style, we work together remotely from all different countries of this planet. Meeting at PyCon APAC is one of few opportunities for everyone to meet at a place, so we had a team camp at the first half of the week. I felt so released to discuss with the member on a white board that is rarely happen, that also build our friendship even deeper.

PyCon APAC started on Saturday. We had been stuck in the own stall for most of the time other than my presentation, as we are the platinum sponsor of PyCon this year. This kept me away from the keynote and the presentation of the other people, unfortunately.

We provided memorial Polo-shirts and Caps to the new signup to our Xoxzo account at our stall. This was quite popular. We also organized a [Code Contest](https://xoxzo.github.io/codecontest/), which is a competition on development of the software using our [Xoxzo Telephony APIs](http://docs.xoxzo.com/en/voice.html).

I enjoyed to communicate with many people from many countries mainly from South-East Asia, although my PyCon APAC 2017 was filled with the busy time at the stall and the presentations of my own and our members.

I left Malaysia with a wish of return to PyCon APAC, although the locale for next year hasn’t been set yet.
