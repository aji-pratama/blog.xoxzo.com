On 2018/9/17(Mon) & 18 (Tue), I attended the Conference with Xoxzo Booth at [PyCon JP 2018](https://pycon.jp/2018/) 
at [Ohta Industrial Plaze, PiO](https://www.pio-ota.net/).
As my residence is in Kyoto I usually take Shinkansen Trains to Tokyo. 
But I flew this time as this site situated very close to Keikyu Kamata station, which is a couple of station from Haneda Airport.

I was looking forward to seeing my collegues whom I don't usually see each other as Xoxzo is 
[100% remote-work](https://info.xoxzo.com/en/team/).

It was 30 min before the conference opening when I arrived, but there were good number of visitors waiting outside the venue.
They all rushed in at the gate opening towards the catered table. This table always was well-attended and filled with nice-looking and tasty foods duriing the conference, breakfast, lunch and 3pm-snack-time!!

The conference was held in a high ceiling hall, the visitors look being expansive and enjoyed wandering about the booth, as well as attend the talks, which was held the other rooms upstairs.

As I weren't at the party on the first conference night, I went to a famous _Gyoza_ dumpling restaurant to have my favorite sour-and-chilly soup along with the local originned _Wingged Gyoza_.

The two days conference flew in a blink of time, while many visitors came to our booth. I do hope to see all those python-lovers again next year.
