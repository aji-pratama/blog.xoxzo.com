Summary: This is the experience we had in PyCon PH 2018, held on February 24 & 25, 2018 in Manila, Philippines.

From [24th Feb to 25th Feb 2018, PyCon Phillipines](https://pycon.python.ph/) was held in Makati City,
Metro Manila. Part of the Xoxzo engineering team travelled from different parts
of the world to attend and contribute to the event. We reached Makati Manila, a day before to be all
geared up for the conference.

language helps Scientists like her to do complex computations, and get results quicker.

The next keynote speaker was Al Sweigart who explained the importance of interacting
with people in the conference. He gave examples of how games have developed
over the years, how older games like Atari’s Adventure was not designed well
to Nintendo’s Mario which was designed by designers. And how interaction is important
between people having different  roles & backgrounds.

All in all the experience in PyCon PH was a nice one. It is always nice to meet people
from the community, hear their thoughts out, and get motivated for the Problems we are solving.
