Many incredible speakers, including the Tokyo Governor Ms. Yuriko Koike, 
kept the stage attractive to all the visitors at all hours.

We [Xoxzo](https://info.xoxzo.com/en/) had a Demo booth there to show our
[Telephony APIs](https://www.xoxzo.com/en/) that are used for multi-factor authentication
and SMS-marketing etc.

We believe that our booth visitors should have enjoyed the demo of our APIs
no matter how well they know aout it. Some of the visitors who got our complimentary tote bags
with brand-new design exclaimed "How cute!!"
