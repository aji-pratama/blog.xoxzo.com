Summary: Introducing the first PyCon in Thailand

On June 16 and 17 2018, PyCon was first held in Thailand, at the Knowledge
Exchange Center (KX) in Bangkok.

Xoxzo does not support the Thailand (at this moment) but I personally know [Dylan Jay](https://twitter.com/djay75),
the chairperson for this PyCon so as a show of support for him and from the
larger APAC community, I flew into Bangkok on the morning of June 15 to join the
conference as a normal attendee.

On the night before the conference itself, the organizers held what they call a
"Code War", a programming competition between teams to solve questions given out
by the MC.

This is how the sponsor booths were lined up

Even though it's their first in Bangkok, I noticed they have managed to get a
healthy amount of interest from sponsors, to show case their products to the
attendees.

For the Lightning Talk session on Saturday, I presented the different PyCons
around the APAC region.

On Saturday night, we went to the conference party at a bar

These are the people that came to Bangkok to give support to PyCon Thailand from
Japan:

At the end of the conference, Dylan went up to the stage and gave the credits
roll for all the hard-working staff that made PyCon Thailand 2018 a success:

Congratulations to Dylan for leading the PyCon Thailand 2018 team, and the community for a having a
local conference that gives space, time and opportunity to the local python
users and developers to share ideas and grow. 

Welcome to the APAC family!
