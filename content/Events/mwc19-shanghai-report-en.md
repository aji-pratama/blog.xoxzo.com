Summary: Iqbal went to Shanghai at the end of June to attend MWC19

The yearly MWC Shanghai was held between June 26 to June 28 2019. During MWC
Barcelona this year we received an offer to setup a booth during MWC Shanghai,
but because we have never attended the event previously and didn't know what to
expect, we declined the offer but since the entrance fees for visitors was much
cheaper than MWC Barcelona, and since Shnaghai was only around 2 hours of flight
away, I took this opportunity to register and see
for myself what MWC Shanghai is all about.

# MWC19 Shanghai

This year's theme for MWC Shanghai was **Intelligent Connectivity**, the same as
it was [in Barcelona this year]({filename}/Events/mwc19-barcelona-report-en.md).

## Geared mostly for the Chinese market

It might be obvious, but MWC in Shanghai is mostly geared towards the Chinese
market. I was hoping for a more _east asia_ focus but it was pretty obvious from
the different booths and companies, and the way they tried to pass on their
messages, it was mostly geared for the China or Chinese markets.

I was also expecting a more hardware focused event, based on feedback I have
received from people who have been to MWC Shanghai before, and knowing that
China is a manufacturing powerhouse, but there was also a decent amount of
software solutions vendors too.

## 4YFN

The Four Years From Now selection was interesting though. They had a healthy
amount of startups, although the numbers are much smaller than what they had in
Barcelona this year.

I stopped by the Malaysia Digital Economy Coorporation (MDEC) who was there
promoting Malaysia as a startup destination, and had an enlighting discussion
with Shafiq, who is taking charge of building up the digital enterpreneruship
ecosystem in Malaysia.

# Conclusion

My general feeling of MWC Shanghai is that if you're interested in accessing the
China market, it might be a good place for you to be. There were exhibitors
which are from other Asia regions like Singapore, and even startups from Europe
for 4YFN but for those it might be more bang for your buck and time if you
attend MWC in Barcelona or other events in Singapore like ConnectTech.

There were also attendees which doesn't look like people from the industy, e.g
wearing casual clothes and slippers walking amongts the booths, and even
school children that look like they are on a field trip in the exhibition halls.

Perhaps MWC in Shanghai has a different meaning to the local scene, which other
MWC doesn't.
