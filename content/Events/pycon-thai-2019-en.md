Summary: Iqbal returns to Bangkok for their second PyCon

On June 15 and 16 2019, just a year after [PyCon was first held in Thailand]({filename}/Events/pycon-thai-2018-en.md),
I returned to show support for [Dylan Jay](https://twitter.com/djay75) on his
second stint as the PyCon TH chairperson.

The second PyCon TH in Bangkok was a huge success. They sold out their tickets before
the conference. This time they had the conference at the brand new True Digital
Park, a larger venue than last year's.

This is how the sponsor booths were lined up

PyCon Thailand has started to attract people from around the region. I met a
fellow Malaysian who has never been to PyCon MY before, but is here in Bangkok
this year.

We also had the _nearly_ usual group of people from Japan that came.

For the Lightning Talk session on Saturday, I presented the different PyCons
around the APAC region.

After the first day of conference, they changed the open space in front of the
main hall to a huge party space, complete with a live band:

These are the people that came to Bangkok to give support to PyCon Thailand from
Japan:

At the end of the conference, Dylan went up to the stage and gave the credits
roll for all the hard-working staff that made PyCon Thailand 2018 a success:

Congratulations to Dylan for leading the PyCon Thailand 2018 team, and the community for a having a
local conference that gives space, time and opportunity to the local python
users and developers to share ideas and grow. 

Welcome to the APAC family!
