Summary: Iqbal returns to Bangkok for their second PyCon

On June 15 and 16 2019, just a year after [PyCon was first held in Thailand]({filename}/Events/pycon-thai-2018-en.md),
I returned to show support for [Dylan Jay](https://twitter.com/djay75) on his
second stint as the PyCon TH chairperson.

# PyCon Thailand Second Edition

The second PyCon TH in Bangkok was a huge success. They sold out before the conference.
This time they had the conference at the brand new True Digital Park, a larger venue
than last year's.

This is how the sponsor booths were lined up

PyCon Thailand has started to attract people from around the region. I met a
fellow Malaysian who has never been to PyCon MY before but is here in Bangkok
this year.

We also had the _nearly_ usual group of people from Japan that came.

After the first day of the conference, they changed the open space in front of the
main hall to a huge party space, complete with a live band:

Since this is a good opportunity to bring out a subject which I think is
important for our community but not discussed enough in the region, for the
Lightning Talk session on Sunday
[I talked about how we're not giving back enough to the open-source](https://www.slideshare.net/xoxzo/lightning-talk-pycon-thailand-2019),
despite the many financial successes that we have seen.
I also introduced our [Annual Open Source Grant program]({filename}/Community/annual-opensource-grant-2019-en.md),
to give tangible ideas to other attendees so they can bring back to their
respective companies and start contributing more to open-source.

These are the hard-working staff that made PyCon Thailand 2019 a success:

## Interesting statistics

- Over 400 attendees, including volunteers
- Nearly 25% of the attendees were people younger than 24 years old
- 17% of the attendees were female
- 60% of the attendees are people who have used Python for less than 2 years
- 82% of the ticket buyers are from within Thailand itself.
- 32% of the attendees are using Python _outside_ of work.

It's a healthy sign to see many young, local newcomers to the language making the effort
to participate  in their yearly PyCon in Bangkok. I'm also surprised to learn that
a big portion of the participants is _not_ using Python at work: It looks like
perhaps enterprise Thailand hasn't warmed up to Python (yet).

An interesting thing they had this year was this sticker system: They had a
bunch of different types of small stickers which you can take and stick it to
your PyCon badge. These stickers show what topics you're interested in. You can,
of course, take more than one sticker if you're interested in more than one
topic.

The topics range from machine learning, ops, web, CGI, NLP, crypto and another 6
more (total 12 topics). The organizers were kind enough to share the data with
me, and I found out a total of 1504 stickers were taken. Machine learning and
data stickers took 30% of all stickers, while the web topic was second place.

Interestingly, regardless that machine learning and data were the top topics,
data science was 7th place, while crypto was the least popular of
all, only taking 3% of all stickers. It looks like Pythonistas in Thailand, at
least, were not really riding the hype of crypto technologies.

At the end of the second day, the foreign attendees and speakers got together
for some Thai food and drinks at a nearby restaurant.

They also have a [cool recap video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cOOKMU0Ztw) that
sums up the conference nicely.

## Summing it up

Congratulations again to Dylan and his PyCon TH 2019 team for a successful  conference.

I did notice that PyCon TH tends to have more non-Thai speakers as opposed to
other regional conferences like PH, JP or MY. Hopefully, they can get more local
Thais as speakers in their next edition of PyCon TH.

Personally, I enjoyed the conference tremendously, not exactly for the talks
which I couldn't catch much due to hallway discussions but for the
opportunity to meet old and new friends, and discussing ideas and the
future among the smartest people I know.
