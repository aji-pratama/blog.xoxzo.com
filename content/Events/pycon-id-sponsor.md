[Xoxzo](https://www.xoxzo.com/en/) will be sponsoring [PyCon ID 2018](https://pycon.id/) to happen on November 3rd and 4th in Jakarta, Indonesia.

PyCon Indonesia is a conference where Python users, or people interested in Python, gather to learn from each other and meet other members of the community. The event hopes that everyone joining PyCon ID will not only learn new and exciting things, but also meet new friends and strengthen the connection with the community, and thus the community itself. This year, it was chosen "Python for Everyone" as the theme. 

Xoxzo will have a booth there and is looking forward to meeting you there. We are getting together our team from Japan, Malaysia and Indonesia together, so make sure to drop by and talk to us!

Please visit [PyCon ID 2018](https://pycon.id/) for the further details on the event.

See you soon!
