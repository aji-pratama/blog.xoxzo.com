### GROW!! is the theme for this PyCon Kyushu 2020
_From the PyCon Kyushu Website_
>The theme of PyCon Kyushu 2020 Kumamoto is Grow! 
>We want to have learning opportunities for the growing generation of students. 
>Whether you are an engineer or non-engineer, we want to create an event that will lead to growth. 
>After the Kumamoto Earthquake, we want to support (grow) the people of Kumamoto who are working hard for reconstruction. 
>We decided with that thought. This event aims to lead to the growth of various people. 
>In particular, I hope that the younger generation will be able to get involved and grow together in Kyushu.
