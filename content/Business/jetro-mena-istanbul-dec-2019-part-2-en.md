# Summary

If you're running a company in Japan, and if you're new to an industry or region,
and looking to jumpstart there and start making connections or just to learn more,
these mission programs by JETRO is a great way to do just that.

Because JETRO's mandate is to help Japanese businesses connect with business in
other countries, the basic language used in documents will be in Japanese so
having a business level Japanese language skills will definately be helpful.
