# ASEAN-Japan Business Meeting (AJBM) in Bali

The theme for this year''s is "Connectivity and Digital Economy to Spur Growth in ASEAN region and Japan"

## What is it


## 3rd Planery session, the Digital Economy

The planery session which interested me most was the 3rd Planery session, with the title "Digital Economy"

NEC presented some of their solutions such as how to tackle the issue of food supply with the explosive
growth of human population, which is expected to rise to 9.7 billion in 2050, working to build PoCs (Proof of Concepts)


Malaysia''s MDEC

### What is the Digital Free Trade Zone (DFTZ)

To drive export of Malaysian SMEs via e-commerce and to establish Malaysia as a regional e-commerce hub
Also covers the trade fulfilment part all the way to the end delivery which is cross border
Business and investment opportunities are for companies with their own products that can
be sold via e-commerce, digital contents companies, plaform companies that services needs like the e-commerce needs,
logistic companies, infrastructure and supporting services like backend office.

## E-PESO

Pushing e-payments to support the PH government goals of achieving 20% e-payments. Implementing digital tech can cut the costs by up to 90%, allowing finance companies to further invest to increase their reach to the rural areas. But most important of all, digital payments have been found to improve quality of live, e.g access to better healthcare.

Currently only 1.03% of total payments are digital payments. Within ASEAN, Thailand''s ProngPay has the biggest uptake due
to the government uptake of e-payments.

## Pi Pay in Cambodia

Only 15% of the population has a bank account, which is a challenge to bring "FinTech" into the country.
But at the same time there is roughly around 1.7 SIM cards per person in the country, showing high penetration
rate for mobile usage.
