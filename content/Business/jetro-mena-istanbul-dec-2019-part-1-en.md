Summary: Iqbal joined a study tour on MENA startups and the Turkey tech scene organized by JETRO

# MENA startups, Turkey tech scene and JETRO

MENA startups and JTERO: These are two topics which I have never had the
opportunity to get involved with. I also had no prior knowledge on the startups
and tech scene in Turkey.

JETRO is the short form for the [Japan External Trade Organization](https://www.jetro.go.jp/en/), an
independent government agency with the mandate to promote trade between Japan
and other countries in the world.

I received an email introducing the study tour in middle of October. They had a
quota of around 20 people for the study tour. I was interested to know first-hand the
tech scene in the MENA region and also Turkey so I signed up.

You'll need to pay for your own flights and hotels, but everything else including
transportation, meetings and venues are managed and prepared by JETRO free of charge.

## RISEUP Summit

As part of the tour JETRO offered us a booth at the RISEUP Summit. Even though
our product doesn't support the MENA region, we decided to
get a booth so that we get to know the Summit attendees better when they stop by
our booth.

A big difference of the crowd that we saw in RISEUP and other conference we've
been to in South East Asia (SEA) or and Japan is the level or curiosity shown by the attendees.
They were very young and very curious to what we were doing, and was asking
questions on how our product work, and what problems does it solve. It was
unfortunate that [Xoxzo](https://www.xoxzo.com/en/) doesn't support the MENA
region and when I explained this, most of the people that came to talk to us
looked dissapointed and told me to quikcly release for MENA too.

### Pitch By The Pyramids

The climax of the RISEUP conference was a pitching contest called **Pitch By The
Pyramids** which was done, well, next to the Pyramids of Giza.

The [Pitch By The Pyramids](https://riseup.co/pitchbythepyramids/) is a startup pitch competition for
finalists chosen from 8000 applicants from startups across the MENA region. 14
finalists was chosen to pitch tonight.

The winners of Pitch By The Pyramids 2019 was

- [TextYanzo](https://www.textyanzo.com/), a startup from Dubai to help you
  get cleaning, flight tickets and many other stuff done through their personal
  assistat app. (winner by most votes from the audience)
- [PayNas](https://www.paynas.com/), a HR startup from Cairo (judges winner)

and two companies chosen for second place:

- [CloudSale](https://www.cloudsale.io/), a startup from Beirut offering a non-food supplies platform for the hotel
  industry.
- [Receet](https://getreceet.com/), a startup from Palastine, which is doing an app to manage
  receipts.

I have been to a few pitching events myself, but I have to say that a
pitching event next to the famous pyramids at night was something else.

And oh, the wind was very cold at night (it was winter anyway), so if you're going to 

## Egypt startups

During the Summit, JETRO arranged for us meetings with a few incubators and also
startups. From the incubators, we received briefings on what and how they
incubate startups, while from the startups they were basically pitches on their
business models and to getting investments from the group.

Halan, a startup similar to Uber or Grab was the biggest startup that we had a
meeting with. Other than their core ride-hailing app, they also do deliveries
for B2B. From hearing their presentation, I understand that Egypt and the MENA
region as a whole still has big opportunities on infrastructure types of
services.

Another interesting startup we had a meeting with was Nafham, an education
startup aiming to open up opportunities for the 50 million Egyptian and the
general Arab countries schoolchildren. The public schools in Egypt are packed to
around 80 pupil per classrom, and Nafham thinks that environment is not condusive
for the children and wants to allow the students access to educational material
beyond what their schools can provide.

## Incubators

One of the incubators that we managed to talk to was [MINT](https://mint.eg-bank.com/Home/Incubator/Incubator)

The other incubator that we visited was the Greek Campus

## JETRO and JICA

# Summary

If you're running a company in Japan, and if you're new to an industry or region,
and looking to jumpstart there and start making connections or just to learn more,
these mission programs by JETRO is a great way to do just that.

Because JETRO's mandate is to help Japanese businesses connect with business in
other countries, the basic language used in documents will be in Japanese so
having a business level Japanese language skills will definately be helpful.

For Xoxzo,
