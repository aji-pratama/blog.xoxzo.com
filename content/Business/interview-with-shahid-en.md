It’s clearly visible that the founder’s passion for compiling data and truly understanding what those numbers mean is the core drive of Berkshire Media. In recent years, the company reputation saw a big upgrade after the positive results in analyzing social media input from Malaysia Airports’ passengers, as well as a staggering accuracy rate of 97% while predicting an election result.

We also managed to talk about the near future of technology, and how voice-based interactions are changing the way the user behaves on the
