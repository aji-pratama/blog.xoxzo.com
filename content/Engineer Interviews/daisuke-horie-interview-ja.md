**どのように、プログラミングや、ソフトウェア開発を始められましたか？
いつのことだったかは、記憶されていますか？**

> 私がプログラミングを始めたのは、小学生の時でした。何かのコースで、BASICを学んだのです。
> でも、基本的な構文を覚えただけでした。
> 何十年も経ってから、インターネット企業でプロダクト・マネージャーを務め、
> インターネットの奥にある技術について、学びました。プログラミングについて、ついに学んだのは、
> 2012年に友人と立ち上げを行ったときでしたね。

**その分野での仕事には、どのようにして就いたのでしょうか？　同僚からの勧めがあったのでしょうか、
それとも、旧式に、求人広告などからだったのですか？**

> 最初の仕事は、テレコムMy first job was in marketing at a telecom company in Tokyo, I then worked as a
> project manager in localization for a few years. My first job where I was really
> diving into technology was as a program manager at Amazon. I got the job by
> applying for a job posting.

**Do you think the first job is important for shaping up the career path of a
software developer? How long did you stay in that job?**

> I think that working at a job that gives you the opportunities to grow your
> skills and learn from experience is important. That could be a company with a
> solid training program, or a company where you get a lot of hands on experience.  
>
> I changed jobs a lot, up until my last couple of jobs, the average time I was
> at a job was a year. Earlier in my career, I got to work at different
> companies where I got experience in different ares of the Internet. At Amazon
> I learned about e-commerce, at Yahoo! JAPAN I worked in search and at Six
> Apart I learned about consumer generated media and social media.

**What do you think about software development career in Japan? Do you think
that market is different from other countries?**

> I only know the markets in Japan and the United States. The numbers are pretty
> clear that salaries for software developers are lower in Japan than in the
> United States, but wages in Japan are just lower across the board and probably
> need to be raised.

**Do you think it's still regarded as a lower job compared to other
traditional professions? We always read comments about devs being treated
badly - lower salaries, long working hours, etc.**

> I'd say that there are a significant number of software developers that work
> for lower salaries and for long hours, but there are also software developers
> that get compensated well. But, it's not just a problem with software
> developers like wages being low across the board, Japan needs to get better at
> helping their workforce work and live healthier.

**What do you think developers should do to make the profession more highly
regarded?**

> Software developers should be willing to turn down jobs that pay little and
> also be willing to improve their own skills and move onto positions at other
> companies that pay more.

**What's the appeal for you to keep working in this industry?**

> The technology industry by definition means that there is constant innovation
> and new things to learn. I enjoy working in an industry where I'm pushed to
> learn more.

**If you could give an advice to yourself back when you were just starting,
what advice would that be?**

> The advice would be to learn how to write code earlier. I had tried a number
> of times, but I would have done whatever it would have taken to learn how to
> code.

**What's the kind of developer that you would most likely wish to work with?**

> I like working with colleagues that are thoughtful, caring and empathetic.
> I've come to understand that personality is often undervalued, but is actually
> one of the most important qualities in a colleague.
>
> Incidents occur, servers go down, things break, and developers/engineers will
> find a solution to the problems that occur. What matters if whether or not
> you'll want to work with that developer again when a bad situation comes up.

**Are you currently working in any kind of open source project
unrelated to your job? If so, can you tell us about it and why did you start
working on it?**

> Not right now.

**Do you think kids should learn how to code?**

> I think that if kids are successfully taught how to code it'll be an important
> skill that can be helpful to them. I'm interested to learn how Japan plans to
> teach all school children how to code.

**Can you tell us the name of another developer whose work you admire and would
like to see an interview here?**

> Not anyone off the top of my head right now.
