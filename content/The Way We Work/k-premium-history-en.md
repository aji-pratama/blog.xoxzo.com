Summary: Looking back how Kpremium service kept updated till today along with our Keizoku Kaizen philosophy.

As you use Xoxzo APIs, do you have any worry-somes or wishes if something could be done in this way, etc? 
We Xoxzo are always looking at the upgrading of our service, with the base philosophy of **Keizoku Kaizen**.

For example, our [K-premium service](https://help.xoxzo.com/en/xoxzo-cloud-telephony-platform/articles/the-k-premium-service/) 
has been evolving from time to time with continuous improvement. 
This is an optional service that can be applied on the sending directly to the Japanese domestic carriers.

The service was introduced originally in July 2013, to set direct sending to one of the Japanese carrier au(KDDI). 
As there are a lot of restrictions by carriers and increasing MNPs, some SMS experienced difficulties in delivery, 
set SenderID was replaced to be displayed on the recipients' device. K-premium service avoided these.

This is very popular optional service, it so succeeded to Xoxzo when it is released in September 2015. 
Not stopping there but being improved [K-premium version 2 (KP-V2) was released](https://blog.xoxzo.com/en/2017/11/24/kpremium-v2-notice/)
in December 2017, with all Japanese Domestic carrier involved. As being said, 
this KP-V2 can set direct sending to more carriers than only au(KDDI).

We listen to our users. Some users voice arose to still use the old type K-premium as well. 
[K-premium lite is released](https://blog.xoxzo.com/ja/2018/06/25/kpremium-lite-notice/) June 2018, 
now we have selection of this optional service, whether you use **Full** with KP-V2, **Only au(KDDI)** 
with K-premium Lite or do not use (Standard sending).

Very easy to select these, we have parameters `jp_kp` for KP-V2 and simple `jp_kpl` could be using K-premium Lite. 
How easy is that!!

Now you have seen how our service is being evolved, including we listen to our users.
