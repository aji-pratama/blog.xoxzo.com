Summary: How Xoxzo looks at the people that makes us.

We believe our most prized assets are the individuals that make up Xoxzo. This
basic believe was true when the company was founded in 2007, and is still true
today. The wonderful work that we do are done by the wonderful people that make
up Xoxzo and are for the wonderful people our customers are. These are the
people connection that are important to us and very close to our hearts.

The different people and personalities that make up these connections creates a
diversified and resilient Xoxzo. Companies are different on many levels, but
in the end what differentiates us all are the values and believes that we hold
and brings us together, regardless of our personal differences.

It is important that we make these believes and values public and commit to it.
These are our guiding principles on how we treat and value each other, and also
welcome new members into our team.

We call this our [People Philosophy](https://info.xoxzo.com/en/hiring/) and I
welcome you to read it [here](https://info.xoxzo.com/en/hiring/).
