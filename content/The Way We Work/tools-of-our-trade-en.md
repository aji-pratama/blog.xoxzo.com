Summary: SaaS that we use to manage our business in Japan and abroad as a 100% remote team

Since 2007 we have been working remotely, from all over the planet. Due to the
unique nature of how we work, the tools that we use are doubly important to make
sure we can effectively carry out our daily tasks and support our customers.

Another requirement that we have is that the tools need to be able to process
Japanese other than English, as our Japanese customers mainly speak Japanese.

# Communication

Communication tools are especially important for us, as it requires to replace
the many types of non-text and nuanced office communication that you will
normally have in a physical office.

## Slack

For real-time discussion and conversation we use Slack. Slack is good when you
want to have a conversation right now in real-time, and also it has simple tools like
reminders which are easy to use. We also actively use Slack's call feature to
have voice and video calls with our team members.

But if you want to have a more in depth discussion that spans across time, 
Slack might not be the best tool for that. With contextual conversation that are
asychronous (i.e please send in your monthly project targets, which you check at the
end of the day and questions and answers go back and forth) we just use plain email.

## Bonusly

In a physical office you can show appreciation to your team members by saying
thank you and maybe buying them some coffee or bagels when they lend you a
helping hand. We try to reproduce this by using Bonusly, an employee recognition
service.

Other than allowing you to give so-called _micro bonuses_ to your team members,
Bonusly also gives us the opportunity to increase communication between
members, by making their contribution visible. We do this by connecting Bonusly
to our Slack all-hands channel, and when a bonus is given out, everyone knows.

Bonusly doesn't have a Japanese UI, but since we only use it internally, it's
not really an issue for us.

## Confluence by Atlassian

Confluence is a great tool for you to keep and share knowledge amount your team
members. It also has a comment funtionality which you can use to point out and
talk about a specific item on the page.

Other than a place to share information, Confluence is also a great for long
winded asynchronous discussion within a specific context. Confluence works well
with JIRA in a way that it adds more context to specific tasks that we have.

You can have multiple so-called _work spaces_ that can hold different topics.
For us, we have a seperate work space for each product, role and also ad-hoc
items like team camps, where we discuss the agenda and output from the camp.

Personally I use the English UI of Confluence, but it has multiple languages
which can be set on a per user account. Japanese input is not an issue.
