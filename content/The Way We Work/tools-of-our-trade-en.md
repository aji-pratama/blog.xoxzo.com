Summary: SaaS that we use to manage our business in Japan and abroad as a 100% remote team

Since 2007 we have been working remotely, from all over the planet. Due to the
unique nature of how we work, the tools that we use are doubly important to make
sure we can effectively carry out our daily tasks and support our customers.

Another requirement that we have is that the tools need to be able to process
Japanese other than English, as our Japanese customers mainly speak Japanese.

# Communication

Communication tools are especially important for us, as it requires to replace
the many types of non-text and nuanced office communication that you will
normally have in a physical office.

## Slack

For real-time discussion and conversation we use Slack. Slack is good when you
want to have a conversation right now in real-time, and also it has simple tools like
reminders which are easy to use. We also actively use Slack's call feature to
have voice and video calls with our team members.

But if you want to have a more in depth discussion that spans across time, 
Slack might not be the best tool for that. With contextual conversation that are
asychronous (i.e please send in your monthly time sheets, which you check at the
end of the day) we just use plain email.

members. It also has a comment funtionality which you can use to point out and
talk about a specific item on the page.



Other than a place to share information, Confluence is also a great for long
winded asynchronous discussion with a specific context
