Summary: SaaS that we use to manage our business in Japan and abroad as a 100% remote team

Since 2007 we have been working remotely, from all over the planet. Due to the
unique nature of how we work, the tools that we use are doubly important to make
sure we can effectively carry out our daily tasks and support our customers.

Another requirement that we have is that the tools need to be able to process
Japanese other than English, as our Japanese customers mainly speak Japanese.

# Communication

Communication tools are especially important for us, as it requires to replace
the many types of non-text and nuanced office communication that you will
normally have in a physical office.

## Slack

For real-time discussion and conversation we use Slack. Slack is good when you
want to have a conversation right now in real-time, and also it has simple tools like
reminders which are easy to use. We also actively use Slack's call feature to
have voice and video calls with our team members.

But if you want to have a more in depth discussion that spans across time, 
Slack might not be the best tool for that. With contextual conversation that are
asychronous (i.e please send in your monthly project targets, which you check at the
end of the day and questions and answers go back and forth) we just use plain email.

## Bonusly

In a physical office you can show appreciation to your team members by saying
thank you and maybe buying them some coffee or bagels when they lend you a
helping hand. We try to reproduce this by using Bonusly, an employee recognition
service.

Other than allowing you to give so-called _micro bonuses_ to your team members,
Bonusly also gives us the opportunity to increase communication between
members, by making their contribution visible. We do this by connecting Bonusly
to our Slack all-hands channel, and when a bonus is given out, everyone knows.

Bonusly doesn't have a Japanese UI, but since we only use it internally, it's
not really an issue for us.

## Confluence by Atlassian

Confluence is a great tool for you to keep and share knowledge amount your team
members. It also has a comment funtionality which you can use to point out and
talk about a specific item on the page.

Other than a place to share information, Confluence is also a great for long
winded asynchronous discussion within a specific context. Confluence works well
with JIRA in a way that it adds more context to specific tasks that we have.

You can have multiple so-called _work spaces_ that can hold different topics.
For us, we have a seperate work space for each product, role and also ad-hoc
items like team camps, where we discuss the agenda and output from the camp.

Personally I use the English UI of Confluence, but it has multiple languages
which can be set on a per user account. Japanese input is not an issue.

# Customer support and satisfaction

Customer support and satisfaction tools are especially important as they are the
communication lines of us and our customers.

## Help Scout

Our customers mainly talk to us via email, and it's important for us to have
these conversations in the right context, and sharable across the team.

Previously we have been using JIRA Service Desk, Desk.com by Salesforce, and before that Zendesk,
but the conclusion is that these SaaS are too bloated for our own straight
forward requirements. We wanted to control the UX and UI of our help center, but
it is difficult to control the look and feel of the online help center functionalities
which came with these tools.

JIRA Service Desk was especially difficult to use, requiring end users to
register to _their_ help desk software to access their tickets. Of course you
might be able to change all these via their settings, but understanding JIRA
settings is a challenge in itself.

The email _From_ was also difficult to set on all of the tools that we try, with
the exception of Help Scout.

We use the English UI of Help Scout, but receiving and replying Japanese email
works just as well.

# Development and developer tools

I'll introduce you to some of the SaaS that we use within the engineering team.
As these tools are used only internally, Japanese UI is not a priority.

## JIRA

Previously we were using GitHub with it's issues tracker, and before that
Unfuddle but both prove to have been lacking in tracking issues within different
projects and connecting them together.

GitHub revolves around repositories and for our use case, we'll have different repositories under a
single project, which makes it difficult to track issues.

A big requirement for an issue tracker is to have a bird's eye overview of the
different open issues, who are responsible for them and any deadlines which have
passed. JIRA allows us to do that with it's powerful issue search functionality.

One drawback of JIRA is that the settings are very complicated and not
intiutive. There is a steep learning curve you'll need to overcome, but to their
credit JIRA's support people have been very responsive and helpful.

## Bitbucket

Bitbucket is part of the Atlassian suite, so after trying out GitHub while
trying to make use of the issues functionality, we've decided to move to
BitBucket which has good integration with JIRA.

You can create a branch straight from the JIRA ticket page, and that branch will
be tracked as part of the ticket. This allows you to see the status of the code
from the JIRA page (i.e is it merged, or is there a pull request?), instead of having
to go back and forth from the ticket page to BitBucket.

## GitHub

We use GitHub to host our public libraries for our Xoxzo Cloud Telephony
product. We also use GitHub to host our blog and Help Center pages.

# Conclusion

There are many SaaS available for the common issues that your business will
face. For us, we needed to have something simple that will fit with the workflow
of our small team, but at the same time will be able to handle different
languages.

Of course, this list is not set in stone. As new requirements come out and new
SaaS becomes available, we'll continue to reiterate with different services to
fit our current work flow of the day.
