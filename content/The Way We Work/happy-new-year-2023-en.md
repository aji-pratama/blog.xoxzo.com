Summary: 2022 was another zap, since the company was merged in the previous year 

## The best wishes for 2023 from Accrete and Xoxzo
</br>
I would like to extend my best wishes for the start of the New Year in 2023. 
</br>
Since we have become a part of the Accrete Co., Ltd. group, 
a company which also develops SMS delivery services, 
this is our second New Year to celebrate together. 
</br>
</br>
## The characteristics of Xoxzo's service
It is the first time for me to send the New Year Regards in this way, 
and I want to talk about the difference between the services of our parent company, 
Accrete, and our service at Xoxzo.
</br>
In a nutshell, both Accrete's and Xoxzo's services are described with the same words 
as "SMS delivery services", so I would like to briefly talk about the differences 
and explain those in a simple way for those who are not sure about this.
</br>
Xoxzo's SMS delivery service is characterized by being "<b>flexible</b>" and "<b>fast & easy</b>‚Äù.
</br>
<b>Flexible</b>: Displays an alphabetical name, rather than a phone number as the SMS sender. 
<b>Fast & easy</b>: Credit card payment is supported and ready for immediate use. 
</br>
This service is intended for users who want to use a "<b>flexible</b>" and "<b>fast & easy</b>" service. 
</br>

## The Xoxzonians
Also, Xoxzo is a small company with about 10 employees, 
but there are many different nationalities and we have people 
working from Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, the Netherlands, 
and Japan, and of course, customer support can be provided in both Japanese and English. 
</br>
These members in one Xoxzo-team work in harmony to provide services to our users. 
</br>
</br>
Please feel free to contact us if you are looking for a "<b>flexible</b>" and "<b>fast & easy</b>" 
SMS delivery service. 
</br>
My New Year greeting seems to be filled with service advertisements, 
but please expect our continuous hard work this year to provide a service that satisfies the users.
