# WFH Series: Episode 1, Part 3

Continuing from [Part 2]({filename}/The Way We Work/wfh-covid19-02-en.md), we'll
go to the working setup of the last four members of our team.

## Our Working Setup

With the need to continue working from home, we have cleared up our work
stations and taken in bigger monitors. Most of us have a fixed place in our
homes to work, while others work at the dining or kitchen table.

[Aiko](/author/aiko-yokoyama.html)'s (L) and [Akira](/author/akira-nonaka.html)'s (R) setups

Comment by Aiko explaining her setup:
> I work with just one laptop. I also keep 4-5 mobile phones in handy for the frequent test of our APIs.
> Regularly working on the lounge sofa then moving into the car for the kids' after-school activities.
> As the lounge is now occupied by kids since the school closure started, I work on the dining table. 

Comment by Akira:
> This my WFH setup. I usually close my MacBook at home when an external display is connected due to
> the space on my desk. When I a have video meeting, I will open the MacBook or use a mobile phone to send video.

### Surya and Jules

[Surya](/author/surya-banerjee.html)'s (L) and Jules's (R) setups

Surya's comments on his setup:
> I have a thing or two for large displays, so I like having a large display attached to my computer.
> I tend to divide the screen into multiple small screens when working, while it doubles down as a part
> of my gaming rig on lazy evenings. However, for complete concentration, the laptop screen serves best
> with its limited screen real estate to keep your mind in one place.

Comment from Jules explaining his setup:
> I work inside my room and it really helped me boost my productivity. I am a morning person,
> so when I wake up, I just go to my desk, sit down, relax, listen to a bit of my music then start away with coding.

That's it from the last four of our team members. This is the last part of this
episode but we'll continue writing about the different things we're doing
during this WFH period.
