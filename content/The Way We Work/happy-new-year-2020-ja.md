# Our Mission

Our mission for the past decade has been to **make communications easier and
better** for many. This, in essence, will not change, but _how_ the communication
can be better and _which group of people_ we will help and serve will.

The fact is, the groups of people that have found us useful and we have worked with
have changed over the years, from consumers like foreigners living in Japan to
people outside of the country, and from companies that are marketing agencies
to companies that are deploying apps.

_How_ we can make communications easier has also evolved. First, it was to make
it accessible and affordable for consumers, then it was to make it accessible
for companies through simple APIs, and now making it available on different
channels such as outgoing or incoming voice or SMS for companies to stay in
touch with their customers via our [EZSMS](https://www.ezsms.biz/en/) and
[Xoxzo](https://www.xoxzo.com/en/) products.

## Heading into 2020

As we head into 2020, we will be facing challenges that will require us to adapt
and execute. 

An immediate one is **competition and pricing**: We have seen many competitors
pop up within the last two years offering crazy pricing commoditizing services
like messaging and voice calls. We have been following a strategy of making it
easy to integrate to our customers' systems while maintaining a quality service
with competitive pricing, but now lacking a strong differentiator, this easy
integration method has also proved to allow our customers to move away
relatively easily to much cheaper but very similar solutions.

We believe that a race to the bottom lacking innovation and
added value doesn't benefit anybody, most of all our customers as quality
stagnate. We need to pave a new way forward adding more value through our
solutions. More about that below:

Another challenge is **staying relevant**: With all the new competition
accessibility to an easier means of communication has become more and more
available. We cannot stick to the previous definition of _easier and better communication_
as being a service to reduce the technical and monetary hurdles allowing bytes
to move from point A to point B anymore but move to a new definition of easier
and better communication that means _clarity_ and _more value_. Communications
that are clear and bring visible value are easier to receive and better
valued.

Finally, we need to **improve and strengthen our culture**: In the context of our work culture,
the 20s will be a decade of remote, async-non-blocking, distributed and freedom.

What we usually did together in the same space-time is now unraveled into different
threads, which while has removed shackles from ourselves and allowed more personal
freedom to pursue ideals, is creating a challenge to keep these independent threads
tied at the right points and still making sense of it all.

# To summarize

To our customers, we hope that you stick with us too in 2020, while we go
through your pain points, try to understand them better, and offer better ways
to make your business strive.

To our team in Xoxzo, it's going to be a rough year ahead (well, when has it
never been rough anyway?) but your continuous ability to grow and adapt to new stuff that
comes our way has never ceased to surprise and delight me.

And finally to everyone else: Stay connected on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/xoxzocom/) or signup to
our [mailing list](https://info.xoxzo.com/en/exchange-mailing-list/) and we'll surprise
you with new stuff that we'll roll out in 2020!

Until next time, take it easy and take care!
