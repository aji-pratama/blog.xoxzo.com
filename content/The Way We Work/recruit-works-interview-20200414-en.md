Works featured an inteview about our no-office working style since the company's
founding, even before words like nomad or remote worker became mainstream. The
interview is featured from page 28 to page 30.

They also featured the unique and modern working styles of other companies, such
as Tokyu Land Corporation, ANA and Euglena.
