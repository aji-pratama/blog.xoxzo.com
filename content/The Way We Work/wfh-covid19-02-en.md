Summary: The Xoxzo team shows what kind of setup do they have working from home during the COVID19 crisis. Part 2.

# WFH Series: Episode 1, Part 2

Continuing from [Part 1]({filename}/The Way We Work/wfh-covid19-01-en.md), we'll
go to the working setup of another four members of our team.

## Our Working Setup

Some of us have started beefing up our workstation setup at home. Here is a
sneak peek of how they look like:

### Arthur and Zaki

[Zaki](/author/zaki-akhmad.html)'s (L) and [Arthur](/author/arthur-sultanbekov.html)'s (R) setups

Comment by Zaki explaining his setup:
> Mainly I turn off my laptop monitor and only using the external monitor. I use a simple laptop
> stand and it makes me better on typing. I also use a USB mouse which makes it easier for
> moving the cursor.

Comment by Arthur:
> I use only one display, usually external monitor, because it's big enough to work comfortably.
> I like to keep my table clean, without anything on it distracting my attention.
> I use a laptop when I want to move to another place, or when I have a video conference.

### Jeong and Fathur

[Jeong](/author/hyejeong-park.html)'s (L) and Fathur's (R) setups

Jeong comments on her setup:
> I’m using a standing desk and external monitor to help with my posture, but I’ve never used the standing desk for standing!
> The extra screen lets me easily check my design outcome while I’m writing code with the other screen.

Comment by Fathur explaining his setup:
> I prefer ample space for hand rest. Coding mainly done at Macbook because of the sharpness
> of Retina screen, and secondary monitor serves as the preview. I can only work properly
> when I have a proper desk and chair available.

That's it from four more of our team members. We'll continue with the series in [our last part]({filename}/The Way We Work/wfh-covid19-04-en.md) with more examples from the rest of our team.
