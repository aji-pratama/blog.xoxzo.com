Summary: Xoxzo welcomes your children's participation in our workspace

As you have noticed by now we are a fully remote team working together from
places that we love, which nearly all the time will be our homes. And being
home, you'll have many distractions that will keep you away from doing work.

While preparing to write
[How to overcome the 3 biggest home office problems]({filename}/The Way We Work/overcoming-home-office-problems-en.md)
for our March post, we asked the team how do they handle these distractions: Well, as pointed out by
Kamal through a
[piece](https://m.signalvnoise.com/why-i-work-remotely-hint-it-has-nothing-to-do-with-productivity-34ace30f74fc)
written by Jason Zimdars, sometimes you embrace them. That's the last point in
the March article.

# Welcomed interruption and participation

In one of our video weekly calls, Aiko's daughter came to greet us and showed us
some stuff that she has been doing. That weekly call reminded me of something I wanted to
write about our work environment.

People and their loved ones are important. If you have not, I suggest that you
also read [Our People Philosophy]({filename}/The Way We Work/our-people-philosophy-en.md)
to understand better where we are trying to head.

I believe these are things which needs to be made clear from the top and written
down so there is no ambiguity or assumption among us. These are one of the
explicit things we need to define to move our company culture in a direction we
want it to go.

Because we believe in community and family as being important, I want to
specifically make it clear to our team members and also to the public that we welcome
children in our workplace. They can listen in to our different calls if they want and if
you for some reason have ever felt that _it might not be proper to have your child on your
lap during a call_ then take this as assurance that **it is totally fine and
welcomed**.

I personally feel that it is a good thing for children to see and experience their
parents at work and maybe get to know who their parents work mates are.
In our current modern world now I think there is little opportunity for them to do so.

## To remind us what counts

Perhaps many years from now, when things go too fast and too big for us,
and we be on the verge of loosing sight of what we were and what we wanted to be,
I hope these writings will help to remind and realign ourselves to how important those
interruption really are.
