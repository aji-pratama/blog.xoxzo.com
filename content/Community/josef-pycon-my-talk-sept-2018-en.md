Summary: During PyCon MY 2018 I gave a talk about how I conduct my trainings

This post is about my talk during PyCon MY 2018. It's a good follow-up post to [Jenna's experience in PyCon MY](https://blog.xoxzo.com/2018/09/05/pycon-my-2018/) where the talk was also mentioned. Here I'll provide some details about my talk.

The audience I had in mind include educators, tech groups, and people or organizations who conduct trainings. Maybe you do it regularly for work, or one time you had to train someone's replacement or a new team member. As part of an organization or a community, it may be because you were invited or assigned the task to share your knowledge. There are many reasons for someone to suddenly find themselves with the need to conduct some training. Participants may be attending for free, paying for themselves or paid for by their company. For trainings where attendees pay, more attendees means more earnings for you. Maybe some big change happened in the company and you suddenly find yourself with a huge room of participants.

In any case, having the flexibility to be able to handle groups of varying sizes will be beneficial to everyone. But for larger groups, more problems arise. More questions are asked, more errors happen. Sometimes, it just takes longer for someone to follow along. And maybe it just so happened that there's a lot of them in a particular event. The larger the group, the harder it is to manage and the bigger the chances of things to go wrong. This lowers the overall quality received by larger groups. If we want to increase the size of the class, we sill want to maintain the value we deliver. In startup land or in our tech communities someone eventually asks the question "Does it scale?"

Here I'll share some insights from my experience. They can be applied to other things but for my purpose, I improved how I conduct trainings, which allowed me to increase the number of attendees I can handle in a class.

* Better tools - there's a saying about using the right tool for the job
* Rethink methods - tools we use allow us to change the way we work
* Empower individuals - treating the class as one unit vs each attendee as a unit
* Interaction is essential - make social interaction work for you, not disrupt you

The main tool I use is the Jupyter notebook. I think it's great for teaching. Many talks and demos use it to tell a narrative together with interactive code snippets. When used to teach programming, it speeds things up by removing the need to type everything from scratch and the need to listen to someone in front. It also lets participants play with code more comfortably and let them have a faster feedback loop.

In terms of how I conduct the class, aside from preparing a repository of notebooks that let them progress step by step with my guidance, I prepare them by giving them ways to handle bugs and find their way around problems. This way, they have more confidence while learning. I assure them it won't be easy to break things, but just in case, there's a reset button. I just make sure they don't feel like they're lost. At some point, they get a good grasp of using the notebooks, instead of talking in front, I encourage them to go ahead at their own pace and I get to walk around, which becomes an opportunity for some people to ask me questions when I'm near. I won't hold them back by disrupting their flow or making them wait while I speak in front. This way I can also go around and focus on giving individual guidance.

This method focuses on empowering individuals. We can treat the class as one unit but at the end of the day, everyone goes home and makes their own evaluation about the value they gained from attending. Treating the class as one versus seeing each as an individual opens up an opportunity for more flexibility. By having both approaches, there's a lot of benefits to them but there's also a the benefit of becoming a more flexible trainer.

As individuals, interaction is essential to learning. Our peers help us understand what we do or don't know and it also prepares us to work with a team. In traditional classes, asking your seatmate can disrupt the class. But with individuals working on their own notebooks, it can teach them many things like how to better ask questions or show solutions. With individuals working asynchronously, the problem may have been solved by already or someone may have an insight that can lead to a solution that can help the rest.

There are disadvantates to this like the requirement to setup notebooks and the need to spend some time learning how to use them. For a beginner class, it may take some time before they actually get started. But I believe the advantages outweigh the disadvantages since they can take the notebooks with them and continue with the rest at their own pace. I merely set them in the right direction and enable them to continue. It's a lot like the difference between giving them fish and teaching them how to fish. Since the lessons are already in the notebooks and not in what I say in the session, what they get out of it depends on their effort. They can't suddenly say "I know Python-fu!" after stepping out of the class but the road ahead is clear and it's up to them. I also have to mention, Jupyter notebooks can also be used with kernels for different languages.

At the beginning of class, it starts out more like a traditional class but towards the end, we see them working individually with the transition happening as they learn how to use the notebooks prepared beforehand. Since most of them can work on the material alone, some people will naturally be faster than others, much faster than if we did a traditional class. One interesting thing I realized was that after every training, I know exactly who I would hire. This is if the class wasn't too big and that I can still monitor their progress to a certain extent. With this method, the largest group that I was able to handle was 120 people.
