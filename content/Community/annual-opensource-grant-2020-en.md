Summary: We're announcing our Annual Open Source grant and recipients for 2020

# The Annual Open Source grant

Spring is here, and amid the current bleak situation around the world due to the
pandemi, it is time for us to announce our grant recipients for 2020.

If you're not familiar with our **Annual Open Source grant program**, you can read
the post for our initial grant [here]({filename}/Community/annual-opensource-grant-2018-en.md)

You can also read about the [recipients for last year's grant]({filename}/Community/annual-opensource-grant-2019-en.md).

## Grant recipients for 2020

For 2020, we have allocated USD2,584 to be distributed among different open source projects.
Out of that, USD1,584 was distributed to projects chosen by the engineering team, while USD1,000 was
specially granted to the Python Software Foundation (PSF).

### [Python Software Foundation (PSF)](https://www.python.org/psf/donations/)

[PyCon 2020 was cancelled by the PSF](https://pycon.blogspot.com/2020/03/pycon-us-2020-in-pittsburgh.html)
due to the escalation of the COVID19 pandemic in the United States. The yearly PyCon conference contribute 
a substantial sum to the running of the PSF, which also includes grants to Python
infrastructure projects that all of us rely on. The cancellation of PyCon 2020
[will impact directly the work of the PSF](http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2020/03/psfs-projected-2020-financial-outcome.html).


*We use Python in all of our products, and the Python community including the
PSF has also supported us since we started over 13 years ago.
As a show of support to the important work that the PSF does, [we have committed to contribute USD1,000 to
help the PSF](https://twitter.com/iqbalabd/status/1238477812077441024?s=19) in what little way we can through these tough times.*

### [Caddy web server](https://caddyserver.com/)

We donated a total of USD300 (USD25 x 12 months) to the project through [Matt Holts's GitHub
Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/mholt) program.


*Caddy is an exciting open source project. Taking new look at decade old paradigm on how web server supposed to work.
The config file syntax is refreshing and automatic https is super handy. While we’re not using it in production yet,
we wish the time will come soon, especially with the new caddy2 release. For now, we use it to help in our development environment.
Try to search "poor man ngrok"*

### [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/)

We have contributed USD300 through Justin Mayer for the [Pelican Dev Team](https://donate.getpelican.com/)
who is maintaining the project. 


*Well, Pelican is the reason you’re reading this very blog post. We think it's instrumental to try to make the donation an annual ritual.*

### [psycopg](https://www.psycopg.org/)

We donated a total of USD384 (USD32 x 12 months) to the project through [Daniele Varrazzo's GitHub
Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/dvarrazzo/) program.


*For any application out there that use postgresql (with python), then psycopg doesn’t need any introduction.
It’s what connecting python to the most advance open source RDBMS in the world.
We use psycopg to implement queue system based on postgresql.*

### [Django REST Framework (DRF)](https://fund.django-rest-framework.org/topics/funding/)

We have allocated USD600 (USD50 x 12 months) for [Django REST Framework (DRF)](https://fund.django-rest-framework.org/topics/funding/)
by subscribing to their basic plan for the whole year. 


*We donated to DRF in 2018 and we still actively using it, so it's come another round of showing our
support to this magnificent open source project.*
