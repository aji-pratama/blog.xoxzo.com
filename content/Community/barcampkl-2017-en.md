Summary: Barcamp KL is back after a long hiatus. It was a day jam packed with ideas as everyone inspired each other.

In a cool Saturday morning in the middle of the school holidays, Sunway iLabs located within Menara Sunway in Petaling Jaya, Malaysia held a very interesting event. Barcamp KL is an unconference, meaning the participants get to vote on the topics that they want to hear the most, instead of being subjected by a set speaker programme. It's entirely possible for a speaker to not get a chance to speak in Barcamp and the pace throughout the day is pretty dynamic.

## What is Barcamp?

In a nutshell, Barcamp is where people share interesting topics and ideas with everyone and pitch for being heard. Topics can be conducted by the presenter in a myriad of ways, from a standard talk to a round table discussion. 

The entire dynamic of the event is very fluid and energetic. Big discussions can suddenly become smaller cluster discussions and nobody wasted any time in talking about the issues and ideas that interests them.

## Tiny little sparks ignited

While the participants are largely tech oriented, the talk topics are quite diverse but a lion's share of it is still highly technical. But all these sessions have one thing in common: they invited questions and discussions that followed. Different people are interested in different things but you can see and hear the whole venue buzzing with people talking about these ideas in micro clusters.

Inevitably, blockchain seems to be the most talked about issue, though not particularly related to cryptocurrency alone. One of the round table discussion I participated in talked about storing personal data on the blockchain, cool possibilities and dangers were talked about in equal light.

I'm pretty sure the other discussion groups talked about similarly cool ideas as well. Dr. Michio Kaku mentioned in his GEC keynote that Malaysia has everything it needs to launch itself into high gear like how Sillicon Valley did it. It was missing a spark to ignite the fuse to carry us there, which he claimed would come from entreprenuers. I think I saw those sparks here. With more of these events, collaborations can happen and something significant can come out of them I feel.

## So what did I talk about?

I talked about running a fully remote working environment throughout an entire organization and how Xoxzo made it work. A lot of people prior to the event asked me on how Xoxzo did it, as they faced problems in running fully remote workplaces but have trouble keeping the team together. I shared how Xoxzo did it and how we managed to keep on doing it for over 10 years.

## Next one?

I do hope there's another one. I'm definitely on board if there is. There is a wealth of information that we collectively hold and it can be beneficial in sharing them to propel our future forwards.

Until then, I'll hold dear the experience, ideas and new friends that I got out of Barcamp KL 2017. I'm pretty sure we'll have better ideas to share and wrestle with for the next one.
