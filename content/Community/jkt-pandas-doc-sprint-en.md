Summary: A story from Pandas documentation sprint in Jakarta

Hello all,

I hope everyone is OK: both physically and mentally OK. Lately, it's been a hard time
for us with this corona virus pandemic situation. Although I've been doing this WFH
(Work From Home) for around 5 years, the situation is not the same before the pandemic.

Long story short, before this pandemic, I had a chance to join a sprint on
Python Pandas documentation. The event was held on February 15, 2020 at
[Mozilla Community Space, Jakarta](https://mozilla.or.id/).
[Marc Garcia](https://datapythonista.me/), one of pandas core contributor was there on sprint.

I could say, the event was very well-organized.
Python ID announced it on [twitter](https://twitter.com/id_python/status/1226677637738721280?s=20).
There were some information and requirements about
[the sprint](https://github.com/pandanistas/pandanistas_sprint_jakarta2020). After that,
we had to fill a form and write down why the organizer should pick us as one of the sprint attendee.

At first, I was thinking this kind of form with the reason why the organizer should pick us,
is about too much. I was thinking that this kind of event should be opened for everyone on any level.
With this kind of form, we're putting some kind of barrier.

I was picked as one of the sprint attendee and later on I figured it out the reason why the organizer
needs to have this form. It is because the space is not big enough to accommodate more than 25 people.

One of the organizer was [Galuh Sahid](https://galuh.me/). From what I read on her blog, I could see
that Galuh is really keen on contributing to open source.

So, Galuh presented how we're gonna do the sprint. From setting up the environment, forking the repo,
finding which pandas documentation that is easy to improve for a beginners, and finally making
the pull request.

I managed to created few [pull requests](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3Aza)
and have it merged. Since I don't use Python Pandas on my daily
work, I don't know a lot about this library. Overall, I was quite happy attending this sprint.
Because sometimes, you just need to meet people - in person - when most of the time you work remotely.
