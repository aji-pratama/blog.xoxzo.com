Summary: Iqbal was invited as a guest speaker at JomLaunch 5.0 in Kuala Lumpur

On August 4 2017, I received an email inviting me as a guest speaker at this year's
[JomLaunch 5.0](http://launch.jomweb.my/) held in Kuala Lumpur's TM Convention Center.

About JomLaunch:

JomLaunch is a platform for members of the JomWeb Komuniti to showcase their
projects or products. JomLaunch's aim is to help community projects, open source
projects, personal or even commercial projects by giving them definative
deadline to get their projects ready by Launch Day.

This year's JomLaunch event was attended by around 400 people. JomLaunch is a
one day, single track event, and as many as 18 projects was showcased, supported
by 13 local sponsors ranging from multi-nationals to local startups, and they had
4 guest speakers, with yours truly as one of them. 

For my talk, I introduced our team, the philosophy that drives us, the values
that we want to add to our customers and what all of these end up to.
