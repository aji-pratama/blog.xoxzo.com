Summary: I participated in a meetup for those who challenge or are interested in startups organized by Bootstrap.

It's been full 12 years since I started a business with Bootstrap in February, 2007.
I knew no one else started up with Bootstrap at the time, specially in the tech industry.
The word of "Bootstrap" didn't mean "start up" at that time neither, but it was used
as the starting of build the Linux OS. It had no relation with business nor start up.

The world is now changed to be "Without prepring 100s of millions, tech startups cannot be called as startup",
these 3 years tech industry is filled with the example of aiming Unicorn with fund from VC and successful 100s of millions 
fund obtained, I want everyone to know that even a bit such altenative start-ups and lifestyle options are actually possible.

Taking this in consideration, I have been looking forward to attend the [Bootstrap Night vol. 4](https://selfree.connpass.com/event/109628/) held on December 18 for the first time.

# The way to acquisition of 1,000 paid licence with as little as 3 in the team

The meetup was started with the presetation by Mr.Omata, CEO of [selfree llc.](https://www.selfree.co.jp/about).

Why in the first place did they started with Bootstrap?
In case you obtained the fund, it turns into a pressure to you,
without that pressure, you can take a full control and focus without being wavered.
In short, you grow your business by operating at own pace with minimum risk.

- He didn't do any development on request at all and concentrated on the own product
- He saved funds prior to start the business as preparation
- He lived on his saving while the initial development and the release
- He secured the funds to live minimum standard of living, as the most important point
- He resided with his parents with the cost of about JPY 150,000, also used his spar time for second work
- He lived 1 and a half year without salarys

He says simply the step-by-step effort would acquire 1,000 of cotract.
Of course, yes, many of the result was made by foot and sweat works in the end.

- All staff kept sending 50 mails a day for the first 3 months after release
- Put a great effort on customer support, customer success and use cases
- Organized user meetups

Then, he talked about his consideration on product development and general business:

- Develop for more improvement than additional functions
- Solve an issue quickest and simplest than any others
- No icreasing extra job, no unnecessary additional members
- Rest well

The keys for a successful Bootstrap business are still **Patience** and **Effort**, right?

# How to set up a programming school

The next speaker was [Mr. Komagata](http://docs.komagata.org/5583) of the joint company Fjord.
Main projects are building sites and developing game sites, but they are currently 
operating programming school as well. 

He talked about a business hardship story of that the model that students started to learn as an intern to proceed the study as they work was chabged to that the graduates of the programming school get introduced to the positions in corporations.

Initially, they take everyone that comes, without tuition fees as an intern, and the interns would learn programming while they help the company tasks, however, they gradually switched to the current intermediately employment model while resolving various problems little by little.

Now what they think after all those is: **Programming school operatio is not an easy thing to do, in the end**, 
well I understand.

# Doorkeeper - the road to make profit

The final speaker was, who is very well known in Ruby community, 
[Mr. Paul McMahon from Doorkeeper](https://twitter.com/pwim?lang=en) (excuse me but I don't use Ruby）

He prohibits to publish and I cannot open the details, but it was interestiing to see his
presentation this time, with many example of the actual numbers of sales and fees of Doorkeeper.

- Doorkeeper was a side project since the release in 2011 and there was no business model to establish/consider
- The first sales started when introduced Paypal, it was more likely to authorization. it didn't create good UX though.
- Groping the model to succeed as a business
- Fee and Fixed cost were introduced initially
- The sales and numbers of event used still didn't make them happy
- They found the enormous amount of ticket sales are necessary to be the successful business model with the main sales on event fees and it is difficult for Bootstrap
- Management dificit for 6 years made them consider the service closure
- Got over it by [renewed as a paid service](https://www.doorkeeper.jp/news/2016/7/25/change-in-pricing)

I confirmed with the talk of Paul that the prices of the products should be set 
according to the value of the user, not to the set number of usage, and the price
setting price for the service (specially SaaS-relation) and product is very important.

From the customer view, it is very important to find out how convenient and what advantage the service
brings in.

# Finally

There was a party with pizza and beer after the presentation.
I met people who had special thoughts on Bootstrap start ups and
who wants to go back to their home town to start something helpful
to the area as urban life has already been too boring.
Not many yet, I feel that type of people are increasing.

A photo time took place before dismissed.

It was my first participation on this this time.
Bootstrap startups are not yet many in Japan, but tech companies that successfully operating with the certain
business models like us are surely existing.
Also I felt there are the next challengers who are interested in the style of startup as well as our life style too.

Although I do not expect dramatical increase in numbers of Bootstrap startups in Japan, where we
have lack in industry structure and issues are still existig, I will be glad if there are more people
to try this way to consider our startup style and life style are one of the choice to make their dream come true.
