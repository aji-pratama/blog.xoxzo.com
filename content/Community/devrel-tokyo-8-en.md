Summary: Joining the English DevRel meetup in Tokyo

For those of you not familiar with what _DevRel_ is, from the DevRel meetup
page:

> DevRel is the short form for "developer relations". 
> DevRel is a marketing technic that major companies have tried it such as
> Amazon, Google, Facebook, Evernote, GitHub, etc. They have made a relationship
> with external engineers. Because companies want engineers to acknowledge their
> services, and they want to get the engineer's feedback.

Our [communications platform product Xoxzo](https://www.xoxzo.com/en/) is API based and
developer-focused, so we decided to attend the DevRel meetup this time to meet
the people who are pushing for better relations with the developer. The meetup
this time was mainly in English, and we had guests from IBM and Nexmo who were
from overseas.

# What we learned

Today we learned a few things about DevRel.

## What is DevRel

DevRel history started sometime in the 1980s when Apple was pushing for
adoption of its Macintosh. Since then, the role has gone through several name
changes, but in essence what it does is still the same: Technical Community Management.

OK, but what is DevRel _all about_? DevRel is basically revolving around these:

- Building trust between the developers´ ad vendors
- Spread and increase the visibility of the vendor's products
- Create active users who will use those said products
- And developer marketing

The first big conference about developer relations would be the Developer
Relations Conference, held since 2004.

Another alternative conference is DevRelCon, which started in London in 2015.

In Japan, there is an annual DevRel conference called [DevRelCon Tokyo since
2017](https://tokyo-2017.devrel.net/).

These conferences would be a great place for you to meet other DevRel people.

## Unique Japan characteristics

Atsushi from MOONGIFT explained about certain characteristics of what works
within the Japanese DevRel ecosystem.

- As opposed to the US, only 25% of small enterprises in Japan
  will have in-house developers. In the US, it's the other way around.
- Users of enterprise software will have a much stronger say and will be
  generally unwilling to change their current processes to fit with a packaged software service. The gap left by packaged services with whatever processes
  they have will be filled by customizations

### Things that work in Japan's DevRel

Some of the DevRel strategies that Atsushi things are unique to Japan

#### Manga
Many concepts of products or services are being done through manga. The
subject matter is made as simple as possible, and explained using manga
characters. According to Alex from Nexmo, they did try to do something similar
but with comic characters (i.e DC Comics, Marvel) but that it didn't work well
in the US 

#### Advent calendar

The advent calendar is a [unique culture within the developer community](https://liginc.co.jp/212709)
in Japan. In December, many advent calendars pop up with different topics and
different groups or persons will write a post on a particular topic for every day
of the calendar. They will then link their pages together to create a connection
on contents about a particular topic. These will give the writer exposure to the
public. Alex again mentioned that Nexmo did try to do a similar strategy in the
US but how it affected their traffic and business was inconclusive.

#### Writing a book

By writing a book on a subject matter, the writer puts her/his self as the
authority of the subject and as a public figure gaining street cred.

#### Mokumoku kai (もくもく会）

Mokumoku kai is getting together as a group somewhere and working on
something individually. The idea is that we're weak as individuals, but strong
as a group. During mokumoku kai, you can rope in help from your fellow attendees
to get ideas or help on whatever you're working on.

#### VTuber
Using Youtube is a popular way to reach out to your audience and explain a
concept or product.

## South East and East Asia is HUGE and DIFFERENT

[Alex Lakatos](https://twitter.com/lakatos88) from Nexmo next came up and gave
an interesting presentation on their experience traveling  around SE and East
Asia trying to understand and connect with the developer community.

He presented to us the different ways that the communities communicate and get
together, from the de facto language used, the media which are used often, and
tools that they use to get together. 

In short, they are al different, slightly among themselves, but more so if we
compare it with what our friends in the US, UK or Australia (e.g the English
speaking world) are used to. Especially for China, nearly everything will have
its own domestic version.

I asked Alex about what will be the single most important thing that he thinks
needs changing on how he does his work, after all the time spent learning from
the diversity of SE/E Asia, and he said:

> Revamp the signup page, and drop things like first name, last name column.
> Their users in China don't have first name, last name. They only have "name".
> Just by doing this, we have seen improvement in our signup rates.
> So we need to be more sensitive to the culture of a particular country.
> The other thing is to have localized documentation.

I think it makes sense.

# In summary

DevRel is a fascinating topic, and different than what we usually think of as traditional "marketing".
Being able to connect, listen to experiences and also ask questions at a meetup like this
will definitely help us to understand better and implement best practices for
our own marketing strategy.
