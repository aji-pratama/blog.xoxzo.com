Summary: The DevOps user group restarted its meetup activity. We got into the second one.

On November 14th, DevOps Malaysia held its second meetup after a long hiatus. I missed out attending the first meetup but I managed to hear about this one and hopped on.

It was held at Nintex at CIMB Tower, KL Sentral and the crowd turned out to be quite big as the presentation room filled up pretty quick. The decor had a bit of a makeover since I [last came here](https://blog.xoxzo.com/2017/08/08/women-who-code-msia-workshop/).

The first talk was about the introduction and live demo of Kubernetes by Bond Lim, who did an excellent job at distilling what Kubernetes was in its simplest structure.

While the second talk was about unlimited storage using CEPH and KVM from Englebert Lai, who showed how storage nodes can be added and replaced without downtime and file errors.

Next meetup is a couple of months away (tentatively) and I plan to keep being part of it and learn new and cool stuff.
