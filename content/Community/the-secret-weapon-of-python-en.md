Summary: Iqbal's talk on the secret sauce for python called community for PyCon MY 2016

Python is everywhere in what we do: From weekly reports to the frontend and
backend. We have leveraged python in many ways to help us reach the goals that
we've set for ourselves and the goals our customers have set for us.

As a way to give back, we actively take part in PyCons in the community that
we're involved in. This is the talk that I gave for PyCon MY 2016 titled "The
Secret Weapon Of Python"

To summarize, what the talk was about is the idea of the driving force behind
the python language is not the language or the functionalities that it has or
even batteries included idea that it holds, but the diverse community it has,
and the importance of cultivating this by encouraging diversity. 

I also answered questions on community building, and how to keep motivated when
it's essentially a selfless unpaid work.
