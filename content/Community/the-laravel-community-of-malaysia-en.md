Summary: Sharing the experience of getting involved in one of the fastest moving programming communities in Malaysia.

Starting from October of this year, I've been attending a local Laravel user group community which call themselves Laravens. It was an experience unlike any other.

They started from a small community but now after consistently hosting meetups they coined as Laratalks monthly, they have gained a constant traction of over 50 members consistently.

After talking to the organizers, Ajay and Aiyas, they started out small with Laravel centric topics but they diversified their topics over time. They're open to new ideas and new ways to implement and use Laravel.

Most impressive is the speed at how they organize the monthly meetups. Notices and Peatix tickets went up two weeks after an event just concluded for the next one, not to mention that there's enough food for everyone as well.

It's going to be an interesting year starting with them from January onwards. Learning a new framework is fascinating to say the least, with the group offering good support and camaredrie through their meetups.
