deliver the most detailed recruitment introduction, offer contents and dispatch information
of cram schools and private schools to teacher licenced job seekers and setting up "premise of hiring" interviews,
uses [EZSMS](https://www.ezsms.biz/) as a solution to the problem of low delivery rate by e-mails.

A comment from [AI-Teacher](https://ai-teacher.blog.jp/) is as below.

_We are engaged in a dispatching business specializing in education._
_We used to use the mailing list mainly to deliver job offers to members, 
but in recent years the arrival rate has been poor, and we introduced SMS for the purpose of digging up dormant members._
_Although there is a limit on the number of characters and there is a charge, it has a quicker effect than LINE, 
and I would like to make effective use of it in the right place while limiting the target audience._
