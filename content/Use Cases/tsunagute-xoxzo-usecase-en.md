> We provide a cloud-based berth reservation service, telesa-reserve, which enables vehicle leveling and cargo waiting time reduction at distribution centers.
>
> This is an essential service for future logistics by eliminating the paper receipt book and managing it online,
we can visualize delivery schedules and waiting lists, and support efficient warehouse operations.
>
> This telesa-reserve uses Xoxzo's Voice API to call the truck driver.
>
> Even when the drivers miss it with SMS, they can almost certainly notice the incoming call, so "calling the drivers" is well received by our users.
> 
> In addition, the API of Xoxzo is simple and the development itself can be released within one week, so we can keep the development cost down and are very satisfied.
