Summary: TSUNAGUTE Co.,Ltd, produced and operates Cloud Berth Reservation System "telesa-reserve" uses Xoxzo's Voice API.

[Tsunagute Co.,Ltd](https://www.tsunagute.co.jp/) started to use [Xoxzo's Voice API](https://www.xoxzo.com/en/about/voice-api/) 
for calling the drivers on their Cloud Berth Reservation System "[telesa-reserve](https://www.tsunagute.co.jp/reserve/)", 
that both levels the workload on the vehicles and reduces the queing time in distribution centers. 


Please find the comment from [Tsunagute Co.,Ltd](https://www.tsunagute.co.jp/)(Originally in Japanese) as below.

_We provide a cloud-based berth reservation service, telesa-reserve, which enables vehicle leveling and cargo waiting time reduction at distribution centers._

_This is an essential service for future logistics by eliminating the paper receipt book and managing it online, 
we can visualize delivery schedules and waiting lists, and support efficient warehouse operations._

_This telesa-reserve uses Xoxzo's Voice API to call the truck driver._

_Even when the drivers miss it with SMS, they can almost certainly notice the incoming call, so "calling the drivers" is well received by our users._

_In addition, the API of Xoxzo is simple and the development itself can be released within one week, 
so we can keep the development cost down and are very satisfied._

_We are looking forward to further functional improvements in the future._
