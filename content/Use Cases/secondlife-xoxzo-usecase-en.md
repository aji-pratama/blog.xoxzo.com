A comment from [SecondLife](https://www.ehaiki.jp/second/)is as below.

_We had issues of non-delivery of email contacts with our client which is essential in our business.

We had been considering the better method of communication with our clients as there are many of them even not contacting us about the non-delivery of our message, although some of them would.

We believe SMS is a convenient method for corporations to contact their clients as about 80% of access from the client is via mobile devices.

The best attractiveness of using SMS is "more assurance of message delivery".

We are currently building System API to auto-sending SMSs to our registered clients._
