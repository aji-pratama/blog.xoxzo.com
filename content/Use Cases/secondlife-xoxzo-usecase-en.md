A comment from [SecondLife](https://www.ehaiki.jp/second/) is as below.

_We had issues of non-delivery of email contacts with our client which is essential in our business._

_So our search has been made for the better method of communication with our clients as there are many of them even not contacting us about the non-delivery of our message, although some of them would._

_We believe SMS is a convenient method for corporations to contact their clients as about 80% of access from the client in current world is made via mobile devices._

_The best attractiveness of using SMS is "more assurance of message delivery"._

_We are currently building System API to auto-sending SMSs to our registered clients._
