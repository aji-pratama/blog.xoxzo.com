Summary: The origin of 2G technology and how it was first used


[第一世代モバイル](https://blog.xoxzo.com/2018/07/24/history-of-1g/)の携帯電話・ネットワークには限界があり、技術のさらなる普及は伸び悩んでいました。 大きな人口における通信の普及を拡大するためには、
相互運用性（例：インターオペラビリティ、国際ローミング）と手頃な価格（より安価な携帯電話とサービス）が不可欠となっていました

[第一世代モバイル](https://blog.xoxzo.com/2018/07/24/history-of-1g/)の散発的・競争的な開発とは対照的に、第二世代モバイル通信技術の開発は、計画的・協力的に行われました。 
ヨーロッパ諸国の協調した取り組みにより、次のような技術が開発されました。

-	R21：1980年ごろに、CEPTの電気通信委員会、無線通信作業部会、および周波数に関する[作業副部会](http://www.gsmhistory.com/the-beginnings/)R21は、
国際周波数割当テーブルにおいて900MHzで移動サービスを追加することに成功し、
新しく一般モバイル通信用の総容量1000チャネル（2 x 25 MHz）をつくりだすとともに、2G通信に利用できる周波数スペクトラムへの道を切り開きました。

-	GSM: In 1982, the [GSM (Groupe Special Mobile)](http://www.gsmhistory.com/chapter/an-upromising-start/) working group was formed by the Telecommunications Commission of CEPT to harmonize the technical and operational characteristics of a public mobile communications system in the 900 MHz band;
 
-	ETSI: Established in 1988 to define the [standards and technical specification](https://www.etsi.org/) for GSM (Global System for Mobile communications) technology. 

[GSM](https://www.gsma.com/) became the predominant 2G technology that swept through most parts of the world, and went on to serve 80% of the mobile market in the decades to come. The USA equivalent is IS-54, also known as Digital-AMPS, which was later replaced by IS-136. 

In 1991 [Radiolinja](http://corporate.elisa.com/on-elisa/history/) (now Elisa) launched the first GSM network in Finland. In cases where the 900 MHz frequency range was used for both 1G and 2G systems in Europe, the 1G systems were shut down to make space for the 2G systems. 

1992, for the first time, data service was introduced to the mobile network in addition to voice, namely [Short Message Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS) (SMS), which supports a data rate of 9.6kbps. The first SMS was sent by engineer [Neil Papworth](http://neilpapworth.com/) on December 3rd, 1992 where he typed "Merry Christmas" from a computer to then Vodafone director Richard Jarvis on an Orbitel 901 handset.

[GPRS](https://www.etsi.org/technologies-clusters/technologies/mobile/gprs) (General Packet Radio Service) also known as 2.5G that supports packet switching for data rates up to 160 kbps was introduced in 1995, and [EDGE](http://www.3gpp.org/technologies/keywords-acronyms/102-gprs-edge) (Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution) also known as 2.75G that supports 8PSK modulation for data rates up to 500 kbps was introduced in 1997. 

Nokia 3210 that was launched in 1999 became the third best-selling mobile phone of all time, reaching 150 million units in sales. It is still fondly remembered as many people’s first mobile phone that looked sleek and finally without an external antenna. Its replacement model [3310](https://www.androidauthority.com/10-most-iconic-mobile-phones-634852/) launched in 2000 was sold 126 million units, and is recognized as an icon from the 2G era so much so that it made a [comeback](https://www.nokia.com/en_int/phones/nokia-3310) in 2017.

Ericsson became a major manufacturer of 2G network equipment, roughly 40% of 2G calls were made through Ericsson equipment in the 1990s.

Japan’s 2G network based on the [PDC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_Digital_Cellular) (Personal Digital Cellular) standards was relatively short lived, due to the fact that it did not support interoperability with other standards, and hence no international roaming in either direction. Nevertheless, this paved way for the early adoption of 3G in Japan. Despite the isolation of Japan’s 2G network, there were a few innovations ahead of the rest of the world. 

In 1999 [emojis](https://stories.moma.org/the-original-emoji-set-has-been-added-to-the-museum-of-modern-arts-collection-c6060e141f61) were invented by Shigetaka Kurita in conjunction with the launch of i-mode, the mobile internet in Japan.

In 2000 J-Phone launched the [first camera phone](https://k-tai.watch.impress.co.jp/cda/article/showcase_top/3913.html) manufactured by Sharp.

The GSM networks have been serving mobile users in the past decades, and most are still operational. The first 2G GSM network to be shut down was Telstra in Australia in 2016, followed by AT&T in USA, Optus in Australia, and all operators in Singapore in 2017.

2G network achieved the following improvements, and became an important phase in the revolution of the mobile communication industry: 

-	TDMA, frequency re-use, more efficient use of spectrum, more concurrent users support by the network;
-	Conversations are digitally encrypted;
-	Cheaper, smaller, lighter, and sleek phones;
-	Market penetration, mobile phone ownership and subscription became a commodity;
-	Roaming supported;
-	Texting supported.
