Summary: A message to our customers on our business continuity status and what we're doing during this crisis

## A world in crisis: Countering the negativity

As an effort to counter the constant negative news and uncertainty that is
affecting nearly every part of our business, like many other organizations we
feel compelled to also put out a message to our customers and the public on what
we're doing to address this crisis from our own unique perspective. 

We hope this small message of ours will give some positive perspective amid the current
wave of negativity and uncertainty.

## Thank you to our social and public workers

We are genuinely inspired and thankful to the selfless healthcare, social and public workers
on the front lines, such as nurses, doctors, janitors and garbage collectors, and everyone else 
that is working tirelessly to care for people in need and to keep our public services running
while most of us are staying home. 
We humbly realize that these are the people that during other times are mostly taken from granted
by most of us, but are in fact supports the very foundation of the society that lives in.

## Health of our employees, customers and vendors

We put the health of our employees, customers and vendors as an utmost priority.

We have been working remotely since 2007, and we have no physical contact among
our staff on a day-to-day basis. All necessary face-to-face meetings, such as our yearly
Spring Camp which was scheduled in March 2020 has been moved to online sessions.
We have also asked all our employees to obey local laws and instructions from local authorities
and help to stop the spread of the virus.

Having said that, the mental health of our employees cannot be forgotten or even
understated. Working remotely puts a [unique mental stresses on remote workers]({filename}/The Way We Work/Pitfalls-Remote-Work-en.md),
and we have always put efforts to constantly monitor and alleviate this stress.
These efforts, of course, are continuous and did not start and will not stop with the COVID-19 crisis.

Due to our remote nature, we also have minimal physical contact with our
customers or vendors. All necessary meetings have all been rescheduled to be
done online.

## Our business, our community and our economy

Xoxzo Inc. and its sister companies have always been working remotely since
inception in 2007. In that sense, the current lockdown situation in nearly all the
cities our staff is currently in does not have much impact on our business
processes.

Since the start of the COVID-19 crisis, we do not see any significant changes to
our business and operation metrics. We are available to our customers as per
normal.

Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for everyone around us. The Python
Software Foundation (PSF) which we rely on to safeguard and continue improving
the core technology that we use in our products are [being affected by the
outbreak in the United States](https://pycon.blogspot.com/2020/03/march-12-update-on-covid-19.html).
As a sign of support, we have committed to donating USD1,000 to the PSF in the
event that PyCon 2020 conference is canceled.

Not much but I hope it makes it easier for you folks. You folks have always helped us on this side of the world. <a href="https://t.co/txLy9yrBDw">https://t.co/txLy9yrBDw</a></p>&mdash; Iqbal Abdullah ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¾ ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡ª / Xoxzo Telephony (@iqbalabd) <a href="https://twitter.com/iqbalabd/status/1238477812077441024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 13, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

We're encouraging our staff to make purchases from local businesses and actively
support the economy of the community they are in.

Other than business travel, we also do not have any plans to reduce our business
expenditure from what we have on the budget. We hope with these small actions of ours,
we will not contribute to any negative impact that our vendors and other parties
that we do business with are facing.

## Thank you to you

During this time of uncertainty, we want to acknowledge the incredible support we have received from you, our customers,
and the resilience that is shown by our staff.

We will continue to monitor the situation and will post notifications as the
need arises here on our blog and also on our [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/xoxzocom). You can also reach
