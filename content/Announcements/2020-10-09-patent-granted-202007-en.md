 [The patent system that protects technology](https://www.jpo.go.jp/system/patent/gaiyo/seidogaiyo/chizai04.html) is an "intellectual property right." The Patent Office protects ideas and inventions created by technology development, which is useful in the world as property.

While the patent system allows inventors to monopolize inventions, it is a system that promotes new technological development with hints as it publishes its invention instead. Indeed, it can be said that the patent system is one of the pillars supporting Japan's economic growth.

The patent granted will mostly be used for Xoxzo’s  Receive [SMS message API.](https://www.xoxzo.com/en/about/sms-api/#sin) With this APi you can easily subscribe to SMS In Numbers (SIN) that are the local numbers (DID) to receive SMS with. When an incoming message is received at one of these numbers, API makes a POST request to a URL you specify, sending incoming message received data.

We at Xoxzo hope that our technology will help to build more business security & communication and revitalize the current and the future application development.
