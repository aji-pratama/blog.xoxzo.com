Summary: New! EZSMS web sending: try the new wizard-style SMS sending method that will be added to the EZSMS dashboard soon. 

Thank you for using [EZSMS](https://www.ezsms.biz/)

On Monday, July 25, 2022, EZSMS will have a new sending method called "Web Wizard".<br>

What has changed? 
Instead of setting the sender, receiver number and message body on one screen as users are used to with our previous system, we have one screen per item which makes it even easier to use, especially for first-time users.

On the current sending screen, you can see "csv send" which uploads a file containing a list of recipient numbers and "send from the web" on which you can simply input and send on the screen, depending on whether the file is uploaded or not. These screens used to be separated, but with the new "Web Wizard", you can select to upload the recipient numbers in a list or enter them by pasting directly in the wizard.

In addition, with the "csv sending" method, you couldn't see the contents of the file after uploading, but with the new "Web Wizard", you can not only check the contents of the file after uploading, but also edit it.

You are still able to use the old sending methods and there is no difference in the sending fee between the wizard and the traditional sending methods.
Please give the newly released Web Wizard sending method a try.

For a more detailed explanation to use the web wizard please read more in this [helpcenter article](https://help.xoxzo.com/ezsms-sms-delivery-service/articles/how-to-use-wizard/)
