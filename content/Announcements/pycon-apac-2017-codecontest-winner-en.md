For PyCon APAC 2017, we ran a [code contest](https://xoxzo.github.io/codecontest/)
for the conference participants as a way to showcase the usages of the Xoxzo Voice API.

We received a total of 4 applicants interested in joining the contest, but at
the end of the one week period, we only received one valid code submission.

So here are the winners of our [PyCon APAC 2017 XOXZO code contest](https://xoxzo.github.io/codecontest/):

1. [Zaki Haris](https://github.com/skycrew) for his [Nagios plugin](https://github.com/skycrew/xoxzo-nagios-boilerplate)

Congratulations to all the winners! Your award Amazon gift card is on the way.
