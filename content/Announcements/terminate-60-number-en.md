Summary: The Malaysian number (+60) will be terminated in our DIN service. 


Thank you for using [Xoxzo, Cloud Telephony Platform](https://www.xoxzo.com/en/)
and [SMS delivery service, EZSMS](https://www.ezsms.biz/en/).

We would like to announce that the provision of the Malaysian numbers (+60) will be terminated in our DIN service as of today, March 4th, 2021.

Our DIN (Dial-In Numbers) was created with the intent of subscribing to a phone number and set an action URL for you want to do with incoming calls - such as transferring calls to favorite numbers or setting automated answering messages.

Also, as we posted in our [blog](https://blog.xoxzo.com/en/2017/05/24/text-to-speech-for-din/), you can customize messages using TTS (text-to-speech) which enables you to reach users with landline numbers and cannot receive SMS messages.

Please wait for the further notices of the termination process, we will contact the users subscribing to this type of number.

Also, please note that DIN service will continue uninterrupted for other prefix numbers in Japan(+81), such as `0800`, `0120` (Freecall) and `050` (IP phones).

We are sorry for any inconvenience caused by this.
