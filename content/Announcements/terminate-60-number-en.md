Summary: The Malaysian number (+60) will be terminated in our DIN service. 


Thank you for using [Xoxzo, Cloud Telephony Platform](https://www.xoxzo.com/en/)
and [SMS delivery service, EZSMS](https://www.ezsms.biz/en/).

Please let us inform you that the provision of the Malaysian numbers (+60) will be terminated in our DIN service. 

Our DIN (Dial In Numbers) is to subscribe a phone number and set an action URL for the various choice that you want to do with the incoming calls, such as transferring the calls to your favorite phones, set an automated answering message and so on.

Also, as in our [blog](https://blog.xoxzo.com/en/2017/05/24/text-to-speech-for-din/), you can prepare even more customized messages using TTS (text-to-speech) that enables you to reach your service user who has landline numbers and cannot cover with SMS messages. 

Please wait for the further notices of the termination process, we will contact the users subscribing to this type of number.

Please note that DIN service continues with the other prefix numbers in Japan(+81), such as `0800`, `0120` (Freecall) and `050` (IP phones) in the future too.

We are sorry for any inconvenience caused by this.
