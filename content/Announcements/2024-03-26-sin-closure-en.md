Summary: SMS In Numbers (SIN = SMS In Numbers) allow you to subscribe to a phone number and receive SMS. When an incoming message is received on the subscribed number, it will make a POST request to the specified URL and send the incoming data. This service will be discontinued at the end of March.

 [Xoxzo Cloud Telephony](xoxzo.com) released the API to [Receive SMS messages](https://blog.xoxzo.com/en/2019/12/25/x4-sin-release/) in December, 2019.

We would like to inform you that we have decided to terminate the service due to rising costs and other reasons.
