Summary: Intermittent trouble of Voice APIs for Xoxzo from 15.59 to 16.39 JST January 31, 2018.

Thank you for using [Xoxzo, Cloud Telephony Platform](https://www.xoxzo.com/en/)
and [SMS delivery service, EZSMS](https://www.ezsms.biz/ja/).

We had an intermittent trouble on a part of our Xoxzo Voice APIs from 15.59 to 16.39
January 31, 2018. Our emergency maintenance has recovered everything back to normal 
but some of our DINs and call transfer might have experienced connection difficulties during this period.

We apologize for any inconvenience caused by this and will reinforce for even better performance on our APIs.
