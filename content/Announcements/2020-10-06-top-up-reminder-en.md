Summary: To prevent the failure for your API use due to the insufficient account balance, Xoxzo has just released a new feature to send a top-up alert to be triggered at the balance amount of your set.

Thank you for using [Xoxzo APIs](https://www.xoxzo.com/en/).

Xoxzo APIs can be used with postpay contract by the corporate/organization users, but many individual
users use as an online prepay.

The prepaid Xoxzo-credits have a 90-day expiry and the users may hesitate to make a bulk purchase.
On the other hand, the moderate amount of purchase can cause the insufficient balance in your account, then the important messages might not be delivered to the end users!

A new feature to alert the low credit balance is developed as a solution.

## A top up reminder feature

The amount of Xoxzo-credits that the users use are very various. This reminder feature is built to fit
every users wish by enabling each user to set their own amount to trigger the notification. 
The notification can be disabled for the unwanted users.

Please refer the details in [Help Center](https://help.xoxzo.com/ja/xoxzo-cloud-telephony/articles/top-up-reminder/) before you use this feature.

## Any more wishes?

**KEIZOKU KAIZEN (continuous improvement)** is the key on Xoxzo to deliver the API service.
Many of the improvements we made including this top-up reminder are to respond to the users requests.
