Summary: Now you can get a phone number to use Voicemail feature. You will never miss any calls!


We are happy to announce that [Dial In Number(DIN) API](https://www.xoxzo.com/en/about/voice-api/)
has a new addition of Voicemail feature now.

Voicemail works as an answering machine, by setting it to a Dial In Number(DIN) you subscribe.

Dial In Numbers (DIN) are local numbers (DID) which you can subscribe and receive calls with. 
By setting the parameter with any subscription of a DIN, you can either:<br>
* answer an incoming call with your specified .mp3 file

* answer an incoming call with a customized message specified with our TTS

* transfer the call to the other number as you like

* store incoming messages in this Voicemail.


Please find how to use this feature within the [API Documentation](https://docs.xoxzo.com/en/din.html#). <br>
