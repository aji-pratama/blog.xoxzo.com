[Privacy mark System](https://privacymark.org/) is offered by [JIPEC](https://english.jipdec.or.jp/), to set up to assess private enterprises that take appropriate measures to protect personal information. Such private enterprises are granted the right to display "PrivacyMark" in the course of their business activities. The System is in compliance with Japan Industrial Standards (JIS Q 15001:2006 [Personal Information Protection Management System - Requirements]). 

Privacy mark is the symbol of how we treat the privacy information of users. The process of renewal was not just to apply but also involve a lot of work to comply with their regulation. This renewal approval would ensure [Xoxzoâ€™s Privacy Policy](https://info.xoxzo.com/en/privacy-policy/).
