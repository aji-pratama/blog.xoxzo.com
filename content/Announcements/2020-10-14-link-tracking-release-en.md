Summary: The link-tracking feature enable you to find who and when clicked the link within the SMS you send. It will help analyzing your customer behavior and make more clean and effective customer list.

Thank you for using [Xoxzo API](https://www.xoxzo.com/en/). Please let us announce our new release of Link-tracking feature.

### How this feature started? 
Do you include the URL of informative website in your SMS to send to your customers? such as:

* events, campaigne details
* products or service page
* important notification
The link is the best guidance to the recipient to their convenient or bargain information that won't fit in one SMS (Short Message Service).

But how is the after-care?
If you send 1,000 messages, don't you want to know who clicked the URL to access your information?
Don't you want to send the next campaigne notice to those who cliekd, to be more cost-effective? You may add more sales action with the savings.

Even you send those messages to your own customers or on behalf of your client,
you can prepare a better report by including the result of link-tracking. 

We are proudly announcing the release of this link-tracking feather, which is sought after by our current users.


### How to use?
It is simiple an easy. Just add one additional parameter on your normal sending.
Please refer [API documentation](https://docs.xoxzo.com/en/sms.html#sms-api) and
[Help Center](https://help.xoxzo.com/xoxzo-cloud-telephony/articles/what-is-link-tracking/).

### How it works?
The first url/domain name in your message will be replaced by our private short link before the message being sent.
In the event of the recipient clicking on the url, it is recorded with the time stamp.

This short url will be expired in 90 days.

The link-tracking feature needs an additional parameter cost on top of standard messaging.
