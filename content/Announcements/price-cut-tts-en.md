Summary: Text-to-speech function on Xoxzo is even easier! Our regular price review and cost down effort has made the price deduction.

Thank you for using [Xoxzo, Cloud Telephony Platform](https://www.xoxzo.com/en/).

Please note that our add-on function, Text-To-Speech (TTS) is reduced on its price from JPY 35 to JPY 5, as a result of our effort on the regular review and improvements on cost reduction.

Please find the TTS function details on the [website](https://www.xoxzo.com/en/about/utilities-api/) and on the [documentation](http://docs.xoxzo.com/en/utilsapi.html#text-to-speech-api-ref), as well as the revised cost on the [price page](https://www.xoxzo.com/en/about/pricing/).
