Summary: Text-to-speech function on Xoxzo is even easier! Lower pricing for TTS.

Thank you for using [Xoxzo, Cloud Telephony Platform](https://www.xoxzo.com/en/).

Please note that we have reduced the pricing for our add-on function, Text-To-Speech (TTS)
from JPY35 to JPY5, as a result of our effort on the regular review and
improvements on cost reduction. We hope with this lower pricing it will allow
our customers to benefit from a more dynamic interaction via voice with their
customers.

Please find the TTS function details on the [website](https://www.xoxzo.com/en/about/utilities-api/)
and on the [documentation](http://docs.xoxzo.com/en/utilsapi.html#text-to-speech-api-ref), as well
as the revised cost on the [price page](https://www.xoxzo.com/en/about/pricing/).

Thank you for your continuous support from the team Xoxzo.
