Summary: Our popular K-Premium service that supported only KDDI (au) will now cover all Japanese carrier messages.

Thank you for using [Xoxzo, Cloud Telephony Platform](https://www.xoxzo.com/en/).

We are excited to announce that our K-Premium service has move choices that you can select from.

Our very first K-Premium service was released in 2013, as an optional feature for our sister
SMS API service [SMS Delivery Service, EZSMS](https://www.ezsms.biz/ja/).

Although requiring registration and an approval before use,
K-Premium has been a popular optional service because it allows you to set the
sender id and uses a direct route for KDDI recipients.

The upgraded K-Premium service that allows direct connections to all Japanese operators and not only limited to KDDI
was released as Kpremium Version 2 in 2017 winter, and that includes,

- Sendings to **ALL Japanese operators** are to be direct, **not just to KDDI**
- Sendings to Docomo/Softbank using K-Premium will set **a fixed SenderID** despite the set sender with `jp_kddi_sender`
- **13 credits** will be deducted for an each K-Premium SMS sent.

Now we have more freedom on Xoxzo to user K-premium service. 

For all those wish to use K-premium service only to the KDDI numbers, 
here we released **Kpremium Lite** that looks up the carrier of the number and
send **to only KDDI recipients** as K-premium sending.

We hope you can well-utilize these options to suit your needs.
