Summary: Usage Dashboard can show you more details!

Our [usage dashboard has been released](/2020-03-05-dashboard-release-en.md) this year, as this is one of the most desired feature of our users on our API service.

We are pleased to announce an update on this Dashboard, this is an additional feature requested from our users.

## text data is shown

It is nice to have your logs and usage data in visualized chart. 
But it is always nice to see some text data beside it. 
Our update this time is to show the figures of SMS sending status, as well as the credits used by each API user.
