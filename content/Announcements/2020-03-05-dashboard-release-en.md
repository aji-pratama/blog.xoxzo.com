Summary: You can now check your API usage in a glance via our new Dashboard

One of the most requested functionality that we have been having for the past
few months is a dashboard that allows our customers to check their usage at a
glance. We're happy to announce that you can finally do that.

When you log in to [Xoxzo](https://www.xoxzo.com/en/) account, click on **Usage Dashboard** from the side menu.

Some of the things you can do:

- Set the period of the chart as you like, for example, you can look at last
  week's usage, last month's or a custom date range.
- See individual API User's usage. Most of us use different API Users for
  different types of calls or messages or even customers. You can see at a
  glance the usage by the different API Users from the pie-chart in the dashboard.
- Deep dive into specific API Users usage, by choosing them from the pulldown.
  By doing this, you'll be shown only the usage of that API User

The Xoxzo Dashboard will continue to evolve to show more data types. Your opinion and
requests will really help us build a better dashboard, so don't be shy and contact us
at help@xoxzo.com with your thoughts and requests.
