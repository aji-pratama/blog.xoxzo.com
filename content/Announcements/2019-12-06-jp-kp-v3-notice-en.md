### Steps to the renewal

#### By January 31, 2020 (Fri), review the future necessity of the SenderID registered at present.

After the change, a registration fee per sender ID will be incurred. 
Please review your current registered number (sender ID) and inform us of unnecessary SenderIDs by the above deadline 
so that no costs will be incurred for unused numbers.

#### From February 1 (Sat) to February 20 (Thu), new SenderID registration cannot be accepted.

Please note that new SenderID registration cannot be accepted during this time. 
There are no restrictions on continuing normal and current K-premium sendings.

#### February 20, 2020 (Thu) (* planned) Renewal service will start.
(* There is a possibility of delay due to congestion and other factors. In that case, we will notify you separately.)

- For the sender ID used as of January 31 (Fri), billing for registration fee every 30 days will start.

- The K-premium sending fee becomes 11 yen per SMS. 
It is a direct collection service for sending to AU (KDDI) and NTT DOCOMO, 
and SMS will be delivered to the recipients using the specified SenderID. (Sending to SoftBank will be unchanged)

- Subsequent registration of the additional SenderID will take 2 weeks, so please contact us with a margin. 
Once you have registered, you will be charged a registration fee, and you will be charged a monthly registration fee 
every 30 days until you cancel.

- Other than the SenderID registered as of January 31 are not available to use any longer without additional registration.
In case of the additional registration, please note that the service will start after 2 weeks.
