Summary: Now you can get a phone number to use Voicemail feature. You will never miss any calls!


We are happy to announce that [Dial In Number(DIN) API](https://www.xoxzo.com/en/about/voice-api/)
has a new addition of Voicemail feature now.

Voicemail works as an answering machine, by setting it to a Dial In Number(DIN) you subscribe.

Dial In Numbers (DIN) are local numbers (DID) which you can subscribe and receive calls with. 
By setting the parameter with any subscription of a DIN, you can either:
* answer an incoming call with your specified .mp3 file, 
* answer an incoming call with a customized message specified with our TTS, 
* transfer the call to the other number as you like,
* store incoming messages in this Voicemail.

Please find how to use this feature within the [API Documentation](https://docs.xoxzo.com/en/din.html#). <br>

If you need any help, please visit our [Help Center](https://help.xoxzo.com/en/xoxzo-cloud-telephony/articles/how-to-use-voicemail/) too. <br>

The price for this Voicemail storage, please refer the [pricing page](https://www.xoxzo.com/ja/about/pricing/voice/#din).
