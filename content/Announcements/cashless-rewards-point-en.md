From October 1, 2019, the consumption tax rate has been raised to 10% in Japan. Along with this, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry conducts a consumer return project for the nine months after the increase and will receive a maximum of 5% point return for cashless payment at the target store.

Although EZSMS kept the users waiting for the return due to the rush of applications,  it will be implemented from December 11, 2019.

The project is also looking to improve productivity and consumer convenience through cashless support. Therefore, points are only redeemed for cashless payments. The following payment methods are available.

- credit card

- debit card
