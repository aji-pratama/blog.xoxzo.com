## Why this position is important

* To allow us to feel the pulse of the tech community
* For promoting the technology, usage, lifestyle and Xoxzo brand
* To allow us to understand better what the community wants and its expects, and to answer this
need and build a cult of followers
* We need a person who talks to the community to also be in charge of open
source libraries and contributions by the company
* To educate, inspire and convert people to sign up, try out and believe in our products.
* To also work with the Marketing group and contribute back to business metrics via evangelism activities.
* Help us build stuff when you're not talking to people

## What will you learn from this position

* You'll learn to be opinionated and to become a thought leader
* You'll learn to stand in front of a crowd and talk and inspire them to try, follow and believe.
* You'll also learn to write your thoughts down periodically as contents for our blog to be shared with the public
* You'll learn to work with a diverse team across timezones and manage your own task and time with little management
* You'll learn the latest trend of the industry
* You'll learn how to also listen, digest, analyze and report on the needs and expectations of the community

## Skills that might help you in this role

This role is suitable for those with 3 to 5 years of development or engineering experience.

* Knowledge of Python is important as you'll need to work with _a lot_ of Python
  code
* At the same time, and effective evangelist should be a polyglot that can can jump
  to any language/platform as needed. You don't need to be an expert at
  everything, but an understanding of what's what will be helpful.
* Fluent conversational and written English, knowledge of Japanese or Bahasa Malaysia/Indonesia is a plus.
* Understanding and adapting to your audience.
* Communicating effectively, in a style that works best for you.
* Being authentic: you must truly want to help people be successful, not just sell them something.

**We’re not accepting applications from part-timers or freelancers**

## Who you are **NOT**

We value your time and wishes you the best culture fit for your career.
Your job growth and fulfilment are important to us, so if you have one of these characteristics,
we discourage you from applying.

* You don’t go **sorry not my problem** when there is a problem. We respect and value people who take
  accountability and initiative to do The Right Thing(TM) . If you face a problem, the team will make it
  their priority to help you with the problem-solving process. They will trust you to do the same.
* You are not job-hopping. We try hard to get people with the right cultural
  fit, and once we do we give them autonomy to develop themselves.
  Xoxzo's current average employment term is 3 years, so you will be joining a fairly mature team.
  If you see this solely as a stepping stone to the next salary grade, this is not the right job for you.

Not every personality is geared for remote working. While remote working removes the
stress of getting ready for the office and commuting, it brings it's own
presures on commmunicating better with your team mates and self-discipline of
managing your own time and priorities. Read more about the [challenges of remote
working]({filename}/The Way We Work/overcoming-home-office-problems-en.md) and
