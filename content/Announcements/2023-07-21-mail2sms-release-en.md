As more and more people use smartphones nowadays, the way people receive messages has also changed in recent decades.

Have you ever wished that you could just send an SMS message to someone who is hard to reach via emails from your company's CRM? 

While the open rate of emails is stuck around 20%, the open rate of SMS is 98%!  Moreover, 90% of SMS messages are read within 3 seconds of receiving!

No matter how simple an email address may be, it’s easy to make mistakes while entering it, and especially if you input an email address that was written on paper into your company's system. 
On the other hand, SMS only requires a phone number, which is easy to remember and to check for mistakes and is on top of that an excellent way to contact customers.

It is also helpful for customers because how easy it is to reply to SMS messages from your phone instead of email. There’s no need to download an app and log in with a password. Besides, some people turn off their notifications for email so if you need to reach someone urgently or for an important manner, SMS is the way to go. 

Converting emails into SMS and sending these messages from your computer is not something that is possible with regular email programs such as Outlook or Gmail. We made it as simple as possible for you to do this, with our easy-to-use interface. With MailSMS, sending text messages from your PC is just as easy as sending a regular email, no need to be tech-savvy!
