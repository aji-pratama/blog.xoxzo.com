Summary: The payment via Credit card on EZSMS has become more convenient.

Thank you for using [EZSMS](https://www.ezsms.biz/).

Please note that on March 12, 2021, a new online payment service has been added to EZSMS and this made some changes in the 
credit card payment process.

The users who wish to pay via Credit cards needed to register prior to the first purchase so far.
Now this is no longer necessary and all users will select the payment method, by credit cards or internet banking
without contacting the helpdesk for the pre-registration.

EZSMS enables everyone to send SMS via web browsers easily, without any programming.
Now, all users including the new registrants can: 
* Create a new account on EZSMS
* Authenticate themselves via mobile phone
* Try SMS sending with the free trial points
* Purchase points online (both via Credit cards and Internet banking)
* Start using the service
in all one go without stopping, 24/7!

We are not stopping either, please wait for the next releases too!
