Summary: Xoxzo released a new discount function for DIN 24 hours only subscription.

Thank you for your continuous support for [Xoxzo-Cloud Telephony Platform](https://www.xoxzo.com/en/).

Please let us announce that on February 16, 2017, Xoxzo released a new discount function for [DIN (Dial-in-Numbers)](https://www.xoxzo.com/en/about/dial-in-api/) on subscription of maximum 24 hours.

DIN Service plan so far provided the 30 days subscription from the day you acquire the number and auto-renewed at every 30 days thereafter. This new additional function will refund a certain amount of Credit to the account if the acquired number is released within 24 hours of its acquisition.

The details of this refund can be found [here](https://www.xoxzo.com/en/about/dial-in-pricing/)

This function can be utilized by itself when the subscribed number is released within 24 hours from its acquisition, in the normal use of DIN as previously. 

[Detailed use in API documentation](http://docs.xoxzo.com/en/din.html#)

We are expecting more convenience for DIN users, by reducing the load of cost to develop and test this DIN in the system.

Thank you once again for using [Xoxzo-Cloud Telephony Platform](https://www.xoxzo.com/en/).
