We, formerly known as MARIMORE Inc, has been on the development of both
SMS sending systems and Telephony systems.

Our continuous consideration and care to the customers' demand built up
our own policy as well as leading us towards creating products that are
easier and more convenient.

Going forward, we will keep on creating and developing Cloud Telephony
solutions connecting the phone and the web, not only for the Japanese
market but the world. To achieve this, we will continue our challenge in
search of new inspiration, technology and initiatives. We will also
continue striving to stay engaged and contributing to the society and
community we're involved in.

Thank you for your kind support, and watch this space!
